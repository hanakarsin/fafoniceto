style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed could face possible sanctions from the All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has said.</h2><p>This is as the Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the party in Kwara state, <strong>Abdullahi Samari Abubakar</strong> disclosed that the party is investigating the Minister over his recent outbursts against Kwara State Governor, <strong>Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq</strong> and may take disciplinary measures against him.</p><p>Abubakar made the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja while speaking with newsmen.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls the Minister on Saturday in Ilorin, Kwara State, noted that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>they were warned</a></strong> not to support the governor of the state, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq during the 2019 governorship election in the state.</p><p>The Minister who was in the state capital to commission the All Progressives Congress new secretariat of the Bashir Bolarinwa led faction disclosed this in public.</p><p>He said as part of his statement that the party had ‘entered one chance.’</p><p>But reacting to the Minister’s outburst, Abubakar said on Wednesday that the party’s leadership in Kwara was evaluating the situation and if Alhaji Mohammed is found guilty, he would face appropriate punishment according to the party’s constitution.</p><p>Samari said: “I still see the Minister as a member of our party. Because he has not formally told us that he is moving out of the party which I doubt if he will go. He is a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria where the APC as a ruling party is running the administration of government.”</p><p>“So I would not think he will want to move out, but from those utterances he made, the party, APC as a structure has guidelines over issues. If we feel that what he said publicly amounts to disrespect or causing acrimony within the party, honestly, we are going to make sure the rules of the party are applied against him and any other person.”</p><p>Asked specifically if the minister will be facing expulsion or suspension from the party, the Kwara APC Chairman said: “Well, there are guidelines like I told you. If the offence is commensurate with suspending him, or any other, definitely the rules of the party are going to apply because nobody is too big to be sanctioned. We want to have sanity in the party.”</p><p>“There are steps according to the party. It has to start from the particular Ward of that fellow. Then, come down to the Local Government than to the state. So, whatever decision is taken at the Ward, to Local government then to state, it will then be forwarded to the national level for ratification.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeran Senators from Kwara State on Wednesday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>threw their weights</a></strong> behind Governor Abdurahman Abdulrazaq.</p><p>Speaking to newsmen in Abuja, the lawmakers described the governor as the authentic leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.</p><p>The senators, Ibrahim Oloriegbe (Kwara Central), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) and Umar Sadiq (Kwara North).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49wZqWZmWK6sLTApqSenF2brqSx0maYqZtdpcKvtdKhpJ6mpGKzsL6MqKytmqWnwLV5wKCYoqajqXqsw8CrmGafn6uys7rOq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nadia-turner-dancer-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nadia Turner (Dancer) - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./former-lawmaker-effiong-released-after-55-days-in-captivity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former Lawmaker, Effiong Released After 55 Days In Captivity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
