After he was scratched, Corey was absent from both practices and games in the following days, which only added to the confusion.</p><p>The first solid update came from Blackhawks GM Kyle Davidson. "He's away from the team and will remain so for the foreseeable future," Kyle explained. "I'm unable to provide any further update on that front."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kyle did say that it had been an organizational decision to keep Corey out of games, as opposed to one that Corey was making himself. On Nov. 28, the team provided more clarity, saying that Corey had "engaged in conduct that is unacceptable and in violation of both the terms of his Standard Player's Contract and the Blackhawks' internal policies intended to promote professional and safe work environments."</p><p>The team said, "As such, Corey Perry has been placed on unconditional waivers. In the event Mr. Perry clears waivers, we intend to terminate his contract effective immediately."</p><p>Corey's agent said that he had stepped away from the team to deal with personal matters. It's unclear exactly what Corey did, but it was severe enough to merit his immediate removal from the team.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Corey Perry has released a statement in which he apologized for his recent actions and says he's now taking steps to seek treatment for mental health and alcohol struggles. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QXE8bUWZQB</a></p>— Chris Johnston (@reporterchris) <a href=#>November 30, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Corey said he was going to work on his mental health.</h2><p>Following the news that his contract had been terminated, Corey released a statement apologizing for his behavior and saying that he was going to spend time working on his mental health.</p><p>"I would like to sincerely apologize to the entire Chicago Blackhawks organization, including ownership, management, coaches, trainers, employees, and my teammates.
