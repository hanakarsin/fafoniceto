Now, they have a whole new legion of fans thanks to Deva’s binge-worthy TV stint.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taj Mahal's musician daughter dates both men and women on 'Dating Around'.</h2><p>At the beginning of Deva’s episode, her sister reveals that the songwriter — who meets up with three guys and two girls during the half-hour show — has learned to love herself a bit more over the past year. "When people meet Deva, they’re pretty intimidated by her," the artist’s sibling shares.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"She needs someone who’s confident enough in themselves to embrace her in all her glory. She definitely has her guards, but since Deva’s moved to New Orleans, I have seen her own her sexuality and her beauty and her body."</p><p>The one thing Deva seems to have always been sure about is music, and draws inspiration from her dad’s impressive career. "He’s like a walking, talking encyclopedia in music and other things like agriculture and cultural anthropology, especially like Afro-Cuban and West African history," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Blues Scene</a>.</p><p>"I’ve been on tour with him for years," she added. "In my older years, my adult years, being that we both have music as our priority, that would bring us together."</p><p>Deva admitted that she worked hard to earn her father’s respect in their shared industry. "The first time he really started taking me seriously as a musician was when he saw me perform in New Zealand," she explained in 2013.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I pretty much managed to come to a country I was not natural to and create a huge following for myself," she noted. "He came to see me play, and he was like, 'Whoa!' That was the first time he really realized I was serious about it, and that I was actually really good at it."</p><p>As for her personal life, "Deva loves really deeply, but ever since a couple of heartbreaks, I haven’t really seen her surrender to romance," the performer’s sister says on Dating Around.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think she’s trying to relearn her heart in a way. I’d love to see her have a joyful, romantic experience with someone, where they can completely fall in love with abandon rather than compete for space."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One of Taj Mahal's daughters passed away at the age of 18.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>Sadly, Deva and her family have experienced more than one type of heartbreak. In 2001, her half-sister, Yasmeen Natisha Mahal-Montgomery, died in a car accident.&nbsp;</p><p>"She was a 2000 graduate of Kauai High School in Hawaii where she was active in theater and drama and played soccer," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the teen’s obituary</a> reads. "She was attending Santa Rosa Junior College with an interest in drama and theater arts. A born-again Christian, she participated in Bible studies in Santa Rosa."</p><p>In a 2019 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> dedicated to Yasmeen, Deva wrote, "Been thinking bout you. You always held me so close. Missin you, always."</p><p>All six episodes of Dating Around's second season are now available to stream on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6recyan5qkXaLCtLXCopinZZSWwaq6xmaYq6elo7E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-emma-chamberlain-delete-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Emma Chamberlain Delete TikTok?
