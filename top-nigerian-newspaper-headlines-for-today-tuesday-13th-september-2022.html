This conforms with Section 17 of the Trade Dispute Act.”</p><p>The Federal Government in its suit, asked the court to order ASUU to call off its seven months strike.</p><p>The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu was joined as a claimant in the matter with the President of ASUU, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, as sole defendant.</p><p>The judge however adjourned the matter till Friday, 16th September 2022.</p><p>With the backing of the Airforce, Nigerian military troops have eliminated scores of Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists in lia.</p><p>Naija News understands that lia, is a location near Sambisa Forest, believed to be where the terrorists have a medical facility and where their wounded fighters as well as those critically ill, are attended to.</p><p>The Airforce, using Super Tucano jets, also raided Abdallari, a terrorist enclave located Northeast of Maiduguri.</p><p>Several terrorists were also neutralized, and structures destroyed by the bombardments.</p><p>Speaking to PRNigeria, intelligence sources disclosed that in Niger and Kaduna State, the Air Component of Operation Whirl Punch carried out onslaughts on the terrorists’ hideout.</p><p>The Governor of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has slammed his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, who accused him of shying away from the burial responsibility of prominent traditional ruler, Alabo Graham-Douglas.</p><p>Amaechi, who has been at loggerheads with Wike for years on Saturday, took a swipe at the Rivers State governor, where he noted that he thought the state government would take responsibility for everything concerning the Kalabari chief and recognise him.</p><p>However, Wike while commissioning a remodelled former RivBank Building in Port Harcourt in the state capital, on Monday replied Amaechi, saying he chose to stay away from the burial because it was politicised.</p><p>Wike went on to give a detailed account of how he constructed the roads leading to the residence and palace of the traditional ruler when he was alive.</p><p>He described the former Minister of Transportation as a “total failure” who no longer has access to Aso Villa in Abuja.</p><p>Controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has disclosed that the successor of President Muhammadu Buhari must be vastly experienced and grounded.</p><p>Speaking to journalists in Kaduna, Gumi stated that the various challenges facing the country need an experienced politician to solve them and not a novice.</p><p>Gumi maintained that the country does not need a sectional leader or religious bigot, but a politician who can unite the country. He advised Nigerians should do away with ethnoreligious politics ahead of the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The cleric, however, asserted that there was nothing wrong with politicians contesting elections several times and seeking victory.</p><p>Gumi said the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, is experienced and has contested several times.</p><p>The cleric said it is not proper for the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to say it is his turn to be the next Nigeria President.</p><p>This was as he maintained that the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the ruling party was unnecessary.</p><p>Gumi said the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, needs to reach out to other segments of Nigerians apart from the youths.</p><p>Aviation workers have embarked on a peaceful nationwide protest over a law seeking to prevent trade unions in the sector from demonstrations.</p><p>Naija News reports that the President of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), Ben Nnabue, made the disclosure on Monday.</p><p>The NUATE president stated that all aviation workers had begun the peaceful protest in all airports across the country on Monday and would continue until the legislation is removed.</p><p>Speaking with TheCable, Nnabue said the workers are demanding the removal of a clause in an act establishing aviation agencies that seek to prevent trade unions from protesting.</p><p>A political group under the aegis of North East Solidarity Network (NESN) has warned the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, to thread carefully with those who claim to be supporting his presidential ambition.</p><p>They audaciously mentioned that Governor of Bauchi, Bala Mohammed cannot be trusted, hence Atiku should reconsider their relationship as the former is pallying with Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike.</p><p>Naija News understands that the group made the admonition to Atiku in a statement released on Monday through its president, Abubakar Abubakar.</p><p>The statement delivered to newsmen in Abuja pointed out that certain elements who disguise as supporters of the PDP are plotting a last minute betrayal for the party’s presidential candidate.</p><p>The group advised Atiku to watch carefully those who lost presidential ticket to him during the party’s National Convention months ago.</p><p>NESN recalled that Governor Mohammed contested the PDP Primary election with Atiku in May but lost in a landslide.</p><p>According to them, the governor’s commitment to Atiku’s presidency should be properly investigated.</p><p>The Presidential candidate of the Action Alliance (AA), Hamza Al Mustapha on Monday visited the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike.</p><p>The former Chief Security Officer (CSO) to ex-military head of state, Sani Abacha, met with Wike at his Port Harcourt residence.</p><p>Naija News learnt that Al Mustapha arrived at the residence of Wike at about 4.30 pm and proceeded to a closed-door meeting.</p><p>Mustapha met with Governor Wike as part of his consultation for the 2023 Presidential election.</p><p>The Rivers State Governor in the past few months has met with other presidential candidates like the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer, Bola Tinubu, the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>Some chieftains of the APC have also met with the Rivers State Governor to seek his support for their party’s presidential candidate.</p><p>The identities of persons killed during the attack on the convoy of the lawmaker representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah have been unveiled.</p><p>Naija News had reported earlier that unknown gunmen on Sunday ambushed the lawmaker’s convoy in Enugwu Ukwu community, Njikoka Local Government Area of the state.</p><p>Some aides and security agents attached to the businessman were reportedly killed with many injured during the deadly attack.</p><p>However, the lawmaker managed to escape unhurt with his bulletproof car.</p><p>In a chat with TVC news, a source said about 10 persons died in the attack, which has been described as an assassination attempt on the lawmaker.</p><p>The source said Senator Ubah lost his personal assistant, Goodness Mathias, and his personal treasurer, Ikechukwu Odum, who is his most trusted aide.</p><p>Also, a passerby who was not in the convoy of the Senator was identified as Onowu Agu-Ukwu Nri was hit by the bullet.</p><p>Other victims were six Mobile Police Men who were riding in the convoy of the Senator, and a driver driving one of Ubah’s cars.</p><p>The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) on Monday as a way of curbing exam malpractice insisted that all candidates must be biometrically verified before taking the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).</p><p>This is as the examination body announced the scrapping of the mop-up examination it introduced in 2017 for candidates who register for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) but could not get their biometrics verified.</p><p>Naija News reports that the board in its Weekly Bulletin from the office of the Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, explained that the latest development emanated from the management’s rigorous review of the 2022 UTME exercise with the need to close all loopholes noticed during the examination.</p><p>It said it has come to the end of an era whereby some candidates will present themselves at the examination venue and claim difficulty to be biometrically verified and expect the system to allow them to sit for the examination is gone for good.</p><p>Sonia, the 25-year-old daughter of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has appealed to the general public for a kidney donation.</p><p>Naija News reports that this is coming barely two months after Ekweremadu and his wife were arrested for alleged conspiracy to facilitate the travel of David Ukpo, for organ harvesting for their daughter.</p><p>The couple were subsequently arraigned and tried at the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in London.</p><p>The senator and his wife had applied for bail but were denied as the prosecutors reportedly informed the court that Ekweremadu procured a passport for the boy and claimed he was 21 years old only to discover that he was 15 years old.</p><p>In a statement shared on Instagram, Sonia revealed she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease in 2019 and her family has done everything possible to save her life including going to various hospitals but the illness persisted and keep degenerating.</p><p>She further disclosed that she is currently in London receiving dialysis three to four times a week at the expense of her family because she is not qualified for the National Health Service due to her immigration status.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
