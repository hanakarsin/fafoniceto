Here’s everything we know about the stunning property.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span></figure><p>Whether you know him as an NFL player-turned-sports-analyst, <a href=#><u>The Deer</u></a> on The Masked Singer, or just a giant personality, <a href=#><u>Terry Bradshaw</u></a> is a name that most people recognize. He was famously the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback who led the team to four Super Bowl Championships, and later became a NFL Hall of Famer.&nbsp;</p><p>And lately, you may have seen ads for Terry’s new family-centered reality TV show on E! running pretty much non-stop.</p><p>Called The Bradshaw Bunch, the series features Terry, his wife, Tammy Bradshaw, and their three daughters, Rachel, Lacey, and Erin. Resident girl dad Terry and his crew are a self-proclaimed “crazy family” full of pranks, teasing, and non-stop energy.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm excited and a little nervous to let the world see the crazy life I share with Tammy and our girls," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Terry says</u></a> of opening the door to his personal life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I never know what will happen next around here between Rachel, Lacey and Erin...I thought winning four Super Bowls was hard, but it's nothing compared to having three girls."</p><p>The series is filmed from Terry and Tammy’s home. But where do <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they actually live</u></a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Terry Bradshaw calls Oklahoma his home.</h2><p>That’s right — the Bradshaw Bunch calls rural Oklahoma their home, and it’s the backdrop for their new reality series.&nbsp;But the residence is actually a sprawling ranch — and a 744-acre one — called the Terry Bradshaw Quarter Horses Ranch. And it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly</u></a> set in southern Oklahoma, near the Texas border and about 70 miles outside of bustling Dallas. Terry and Tammy have lived there for nearly two decades and counting, and their sweeping estate has been featured in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mansion Global</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The ranch was 15 years in the making.</h2><p>As mentioned, the Bradshaws have owned their Oklahoma ranch for nearly 20 years — and 15 of them were spent upgrading and renovating the property to make it their own. Sounds like a lot of work, right? But Terry calls it part of the fun, preferring a property to make his own rather than something move-in ready. Included in that process was making room for one of his biggest hobbies — breeding halter horses.</p><p>And he certainly had his work cut out for him with “a roughly 15-year project at a cost of millions of dollars that included building professional equine facilities, such as a stallion barn, a show barn, a breeding facility, a laboratory and an office. They’ve also built multiple houses on the property, landscaped it, added lakes and installed a pool and gardens.”</p><p>Worth an estimated $10 to $12 million when Terry bought it, the property’s value has increased exponentially since then.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But he’s gearing up for a big move.</h2><p>Terry calls himself a project guy, and is already onto his next (gigantic) venture. He recently purchased another sprawling property just over the Texas line that he plans on fixing up.&nbsp;And he had bought and developed two others before the Terry Bradshaw Quarter Horses Ranch.</p><p>“We’ll move the studs — we’ve got nine stallions — we’ll build probably a 12-stall stud barn and then we’ll build a training facility,” he shares.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Smells Great...</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Tommy B</a> (@tpr0ductions) on Mar 29, 2016 at 2:43pm PDT</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instag</a></figure><p>“Building the house will be a blast, putting the barns in, designing the layout — it’ll be fun.”</p><p>Of his current ranch, he shares, “This place is gorgeous, don't get me wrong. It’s everything a human could want: the views, the lakes, the house. But I won’t be sad to leave. I’m not one to get sad over property.”</p><p>Stay tuned for more on the Bradshaw’s newest property.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2LBpr7RsmSbqpGZwKmt1majoq6VYn9xfo8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1155618-african-countries-currencies-symbols-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>African countries and their currencies with symbols</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-sunday-23rd-may-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Sunday, 23rd May, 2021</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
