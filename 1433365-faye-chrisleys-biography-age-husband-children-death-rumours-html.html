The reality television star is currently 78 years old, having been born on September 2, 1943. She was born and brought up on a farm in South Carolina, United States.</p><h3>Where does Faye Chrisley live?</h3><p class=align-left>She lives in Nashville, Tennessee, where the <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i> was moved to after its third season.</p><h3>Faye Chrisley's career</h3><p class=align-left>Much of the public information about Faye's career revolves around her role on <i>Chrisley Knows Best.</i> <a href=#>The show</a> premiered in March 2014 and revolves around Todd, his wife, and five children. Todd is widely considered unreasonable, controlling, easily irritated by the rest of the family members.</p><p class=align-left>The show was recorded in Alpharetta and Roswell for the first three seasons before production shifted to Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to the <a href=#>original series</a>, there have been three other spinoffs, <i>Chrisley Confessions, Growing Up Chrisley, </i>and <i>What's Cooking with Julie Chrisley.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6eafaf4b1a56072.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr Simone Whitmore’s biography: age, birthday, parents, husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since the show's premiere, Faye has been largely featured in all nine seasons. She is often seen voicing her opinions and providing nuggets of wisdom to her son and grandchildren. She is an integral part of the hilarious family dynamic that keeps the show going. Faye Chrisley's age also makes her one of the voices of reason on <a href=#>the show</a>.</p><h3>How much does Faye Chrisley make per episode?</h3><p class=align-left>There is not much credible information on how much each cast member on the show makes per episode. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reality Titbit</a>, Savannah, one of Faye's co-stars on the show, reportedly makes about $10,000 per show.</p><h3>Personal life</h3><p class=align-left>Nanny Faye was married to the late <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gene Chrisley,</a> a war veteran who fought in the Korean war. Gene passed on in July 2012 and was 77 years old at the time. Faye and Gene had three children together, Todd, Randy, and the late Derrick.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a63a8c1db312c35a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brandon Flynn’s biography: age, height, sexuality, relationships</span></p></a><h3>Is Faye Chrisley still alive?</h3><p class=align-left>There were rumours making rounds on the internet quite recently that the reality TV personality had died. However, these rumours are untrue. The 78-year-old (as of 2022) is still alive and well. She currently lives with Todd's family in Nashville.</p><h3>Does Faye Chrisley have cancer?</h3><p class=align-left>During season 4 of <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i>, the television star had a cancer scare. She had reportedly been found with lumps that, upon testing, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turned out</a> non-cancerous. The rest of the cast members were greatly concerned since Julie (one of the other cast members) had a long battle with cancer.</p><p class=align-left>While Faye's results came back negative, that period was still quite difficult for the entire Todd family, given their history with Julie.</p><h3>Does Nanny Faye wear a wig?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/20bd5056e5e5965a.jpg><p class=align-left>The reality television star has short blonde hair but often appears on the show<i> </i>wearing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">differently coloured wigs</a>.

However, this is not an official net worth figure.</p><p class=align-left>At 78 years old, Faye Chrisley is still quite active and entertaining her fans on the <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i> TV show. Her warm and friendly personality is inarguably one aspect that gives the show its massive appeal.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Dare Taylor's biography: where is Disney World's Jasmine now?</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng</a> recently published an article about <a href=#>Dare Taylor</a>, an accomplished bikini model, actress, and social media personality.
