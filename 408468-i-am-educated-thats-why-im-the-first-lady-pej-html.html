Mrs Jonathan also advised the youths of Ondo to pursue their education, stressing that if she wasn't educated, she wouldn't be a first lady;</p><p>In her own words, she also said,<i> "Majority of the people of Ondo are educated and I believe you know the importance of education because without education there is no future. We should thank God for the administration of Goodluck and PDP. If somebody is talking and you are not educated, can you be there? If Hilary Clinton is talking and you are not educated, can you be there? As Mimiko (governor of Ondo) is there, without education can he be there? As I am standing before you, if I am not educated, will they choose me?”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>MUST READ: What Nigerians Are Saying About GEJ’s NEDG Presidential Debate</a></p><p>In the same vein, Dame Patience Jonathan, while speaking to a mammoth crowd at the PDP rally held at the Gani Fawehinmi freedom Arcade ground in Akure earlier today said that a vote for the APC presidential Candidate Gen. Muhammadu Buhari is a vote to send Nigerians to Prison. While reminding the peole that Buhari is a dictator, Mrs Patience Jonathan said a dictator will always be a dictator no matter how his handlers white wash him. Nigerians should not make that mistake because a vote for Buhari is a vote to send people to Prison.</p><p>Describing the APC as a party of liars, propagandists, and a party of people who have “nothing to offer but to grab power by all means”, Dame Jonathan said the Jonathan administration impacted the lives of women more than any administration before him.</p><p>”<i> Do not vote for the candidate of the APC who do not have regard for the women. This is pay back time for President Jonathan all our women should come out on saturday and cast their vote for him.''</i></p><p>Just yesterday,<a href=#> the wife of the president during her women rally to Onitsha yesterday was noted to have said that the All Progressives Congress will be buried on March 28th</a>. She also used <a href=#>the defection of Rivers state Deputy Governor, Tele Ikuru </a>as an example, reiterating that that is an indication that the opposition party is dead.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXGEk29vZqFdlrpuscOumpqslZl6tbTArapmr5iueqq5jK2fnmWWnr%2B0wIylmJ2xXaWyq3rHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ilorin-high-court-convicts-six-students-for-internet-fraud.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ilorin High Court Convicts Six Students For Internet Fraud</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coronavirus-ncdc-confirms-796-new-covid-19-cases-in-nigeria.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NCDC Confirms 796 New COVID-19 Cases In Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
