In fact, she was dating her former <a href=#>Baywatch</a> co-star <a href=#>Kelly Slater</a> at the time.</p><p>Here’s a look at Pam and Kelly’s relationship timeline!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pamela Anderson and Kelly Slater’s relationship timeline explained.</h2><p>Pamela’s <a href=#>list of celebrity exes</a> is pretty long. After she divorced Tommy in 1998, Pamela started dating <a href=#>Kid Rock</a>. They split after a couple years before rekindling things and getting married in 2006. Unfortunately, Pam and Kid divorced later that year. In 2007, she tied the knot with <a href=#>Paris Hilton’s sex tape</a> co-star, <a href=#>Rick Salomon</a>, but their marriage was annulled in 2008.</p><p>She rekindled things with Tommy again in 2008, but the pair only lasted a couple years in their second go-round. She then married Rick again in 2014, but their divorce was finalized the following year. Pamela then said “I do” again in 2020, this time to <a href=#>Dan Hayhurst</a>, but they split in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>But before she ever walked down the aisle at all, Pam and Kelly were an item. According to Pam, she and Kelly first met on set.</p><p>“I met Kelly Slater on the set of Baywatch. He was my big love actually. He was such a sweetheart to me, and so good to me,” she recounted in the Netflix documentary. However, their relationship wasn’t exclusive.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>“I dated Kelly all the time. I mean, Kelly and I were together between lots of boyfriends and lots of girlfriends for him too, but it wasn’t just me,” she added.</p><p>She referred to her ex as a “free spirit” that no woman could tame … including herself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kelly Slater (@kellyslater)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pamela Anderson was dating Kelly Slater when she married Tommy Lee.</h2><p>In Pamela, a Love Story, the star shared that she was technically already a married woman when she broke up with her now ex-boyfriend. Kelly and Pam were headed on a trip to Florida to visit his family when Pam called it quits.</p><p>"My first phone call was to tell him I was married. He’s like, ‘What?’” she recalled, adding that the interaction was “horrible.” Despite their bad breakup, Kelly eventually forgave her. The professional surfer previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro UK</a> that he didn't hold "any ill feelings” toward the actress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I wish her well. Hey, we had an amazing time together,” he continued.</p><p>After Pam and Kelly’s split, he moved on with his daughter’s mother, Tamera Michelle, and later Sophie Monk. They dated for a year before he moved on with <a href=#>Giselle Bündchen</a>, <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, and eventually, his longtime girlfriend Kalani Miller. Kelly and Kalani have been together for 15 years as of this writing.</p><p>Pamela, a Love Story is available for streaming now on Netflix!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6uscuaZJqmlJq%2FtLvNZqKepJyuerS4wK2cq2WimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alana-hadid-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alana Hadid - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-was-jeffrey-tambor-fired-from-transparent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Was Jeffrey Tambor Fired From 'Transparent'?
