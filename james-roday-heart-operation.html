The first season centered around a group of friends — including Eddie Saville (David Giuntoli), Rome Howard (Romany Malco), Katherine Kim (Grace Park), and Gary Mendez (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Roday</a> Rodriguez) in Boston as they grappled with the suicide of Jon Dixon (Ron Livingston).&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While trying to figure out what Jon was dealing with in the weeks leading up to his death, his friends are also going through trials and tribulations of their own.&nbsp;In Season 1, Gary was in remission from breast cancer, which is far less common with men than with women.</p><p>Viewers noticed that actor James Roday had a large scar on his chest, and some wondered what it was from. Did James Roday have a heart operation?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did James Roday have a heart operation?</h2><p>In Season 1 of A Million Little Things, Gary meets Maggie (Allison Miller) in a support group for cancer survivors. While the two immediately hit it off, she later finds out that he had used the group in the past as a place to meet women.&nbsp;</p><p>After arguing (and learning that Maggie's cancer had returned, aggressively), Gary decides to prove his commitment to her by showing her his scar from his mastectomy.</p><p>During this moment on the show, fans noticed that James Roday also had a scar on the left side of his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who also used to watch the 44-year-old star on the USA comedy series, Psych, had previously seen that he had a long mark on his chest as well.</p><p>While it does not appear as if James has never publicly opened up about the scar, there are reports that he had open-heart surgery when he was 22. The size and placement of the scar on his chest matches one from that type of operation.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Because James has largely kept his personal life private, fans of the actor have found out information about him through other means.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, a person identifying as James' cousin posted a photo with the actor on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Reddit.</a> One user responded to the photo with a question about James' chest scar.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Oooh, ooh! If you are his cousin: what is his giant scar from?" the user asked. "Some kind of heart surgery?</p><p>"Yes, he had a hole in his heart when he was a kid. Had it repaired and is the picture of health today," the original poster responded.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that it is unclear if the Reddit user is actually related to James, and therefore, if the information about the actor's heart is accurate.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is James Roday dating?</h2><p>James has not shared whether or not he is in a relationship (he has active Twitter and Instagram accounts). He does share photos and videos of his on-screen love interest, Allison Miller, but the two have never indicated that they are dating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>James's only known public relationship was when he dated his Psych co-star, Maggie Lawson, from 2006 to 2014. Maggie later married actor Ben Koldyke in 2015, but the pair divorced in 2017.</p><p>A Million Little Things airs on Thursdays at 10 p.m. on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p>You can stream all eight seasons of Psych on Peacock.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66usdJmqaicka56qbHAq6tmp6Cav6LAyKil</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-spent-n680m-to-treat-snakebites-in-22-years-gov-ortom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Spent N680m To Treat Snakebites In 22 Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./401935-daddy-owen-admits-marriage-troubles-began-3-years-i-lock-house-cry-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daddy Owen admits his marriage troubles began 3 years ago: &amp;quot;I would lock myself in the house and cry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
