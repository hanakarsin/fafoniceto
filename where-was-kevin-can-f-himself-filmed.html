Kevin Can F**k Himself prides itself on being a dark comedy that helps viewers understand the plight of a sitcom wife who is fed up with her doofy, clueless husband.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The series, created by Valerie Armstrong, features a unique filming style that takes viewers on a journey into the mind of Allison Roberts, played by <a href=#>Schitt’s Creek</a> fan-favorite, <a href=#>Annie Murphy</a>. The show takes place in Massachusetts, but is that where the cast and crew actually filmed the show? We have all the details below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Kevin Can F**k Himself’ takes place in Worcester, Massachusetts.</h2><p>While the show takes place in the town of Worcester, did the cast and crew actually film there?&nbsp;According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, the series was "filmed on sound stages and on-location in various parts" of the state of Massachusetts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Most of the filming for the show seems to have taken place in the Metropolitan Boston area. “The main characters, husband and wife Kevin and Allison, share a house, which is shown to be in Worcester. Many scenes of the first season were filmed across the city. Worcester is known for its architecture comprising triple-decker houses which can be prominently seen in the show,” the outlet reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The show was filmed in front of a live audience.</h2><p>While most of the show is filmed through a single camera lens and focuses on the life of Kevin’s wife, Allison, as she navigates her troubled marriage and stalled life, there are also many scenes filmed on a studio set in the traditional sitcom style of shows like King of Queens and Everybody Loves Raymond.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Those scenes filmed on a set and supplemented with loud canned laughter only add to the effect of the unrealistic sitcom world. Without the canned laughter, a worthless husband neglecting or emotionally abusing his wife doesn't seem nearly as funny.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Den of Geek</a>, Kevin Can F**k Himself was actually filmed in front of a studio audience. However, they weren’t laughing loudly during the sitcom scenes. “AMC tells us that, due to COVID restrictions, the audience was small and far away, so the laughs were not picked up on the audio. Therefore, much of the laughter you hear on the show was added in post-production,” the outlet explained.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many fans think that the ‘Kevin Can F**k Himself’ set is the same as ‘All in the Family.’</h2><p>One thing that fans quickly took notice of while watching Kevin Can F**k Himself was the striking resemblance of their set to the set of the 1970s classic sitcom, All in the Family.</p><p>The main antihero of All in the Family, Archie Bunker, may be the mold for all the “clueless husband” tropes that came after. Could the creator of Kevin Can F**k Himself have known this and recreated the All in the Family set on purpose? Fans sure seem to think so.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else think the house in Kevin Can F*K Himself is the same house from All In the Family?
