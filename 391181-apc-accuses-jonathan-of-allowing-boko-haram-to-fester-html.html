Is it not curious that a military that has been globally acknowledged for its successes in peacekeeping at regional and international levels has suddenly found itself unable to tackle a band of criminals? Is it not curious that the necessary fighting equipment that have not been made available to the military, despite the injection of over 32 billion US dollars into the defence and security sector since 2008, have suddenly become available?</i></p><p><i>”There are more questions to be asked: At what point did President Jonathan begin to have a clear idea that Boko Haram is a major threat to the very survival of our country? Was it after about 300 innocent girls were abducted from their school in Chibok or before? Was it after hundreds of boys were slaughtered in a secondary school in Buni Yadi or before? Or, was it before or after the Nyanya bomb blast that led to the deaths of hundreds of people? Just when did our President wake up to his primary responsibility?</i></p><p><i>”The truth is that after their Boko Haram-as-a-trump-card strategy blew up in their face and their electoral fortunes plummeted, the PDP-led Jonathan Administration came to the realization that a stepped-up campaign against the insurgents is needed to revive their electoral fortunes, hence they then decided to pep up the military and rally regional troops – the same suggestions from the opposition that the Administration has pointedly ignored over the years – to combat the terrorists.</i></p><p><i>”President Jonathan, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, must take responsibility for the monumental cost, whether of his incompetence or his political strategy-gone-awry or both, apologize to the nation and immediately back down from seeking re-election. The President must not be allowed to profit from an error of judgement that has cost 15,000 lives, forced over 3 million out of their homes and cost the taxpayers 32.88 billion US dollars,”</i> APC said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Terrorists Disguise As Women In Baga - Olukolade</a></p><p>The party also expressed concern at the efforts of the Jonathan Administration to make Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau look invincible, with the President’s statement that Shekau will be caught before the elections.</p><p><i>‘It is no longer news that the authorities have gleefully announced the killing of Shekau at least twice in the past, with the picture of the supposedly-dead Boko Haram leader widely circulated in the social and traditional media. That raises the question as to which Shekau is to be captured. Or are we to believe the stories making the rounds that the government plans to capture a ‘Shekau’ who will then be used to implicate Gen. Muhammadu Buhari as a sponsor of the sect, just to pull the brakes on his runaway acceptance by Nigerians?”</i> it queried.</p><p>Meanwhile, news just in reveals that hours after a suicide bomber killed almost 20 people at a motor park in Potiskum, Yobe State, <a href=#>a bomb blast rocked one of the busiest motor parks at Kano Line, located at Naibawa Area, along Zaria Road</a>, residents and security officials have said.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHp9kHFoZpmgmHqir8Kuqp6rXZ%2B8r63ToZinZZ%2BbeqK4y6iuoqaXYq%2Bwt85mn5qqkaJ6tbuMn5ysrJWne6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1425646-ava-samboras-biography-age-height-boyfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ava Samboras biography: age, height, net worth, boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-holly-forbes-from-the-voice-bald.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Holly Forbes from 'The Voice' Bald?
