Bala (Mohammed)</strong> led committee is still working. They are coming out with a report on why we lost and by the time they finish, we will take decisions and the decision is not for the National Working Committee but for the entirety of our party.</p><p>“And I believe that whoever that is interested in 2023 (presidential ticket), may be including the former President, the chances are there because the PDP is a party of all.</p><p>“Everybody will have that opportunity but in clear terms, we have not taken any decision to give anybody ticket for now”.</p><p>Speaking on the recent defection of some politicians from the PDP to the APC, Secondus blamed the ruling party for embarking on aggressive poaching of persons from other parties while neglecting the business of governance for politics.</p><p>He however said the defections are only short-term victories.</p><p>“Yes, they have been poaching from virtually all the parties. They have been running around but they have not been successful at all.</p><p>“I believe that what should bother them most should be governance, the security, the economy, all that have broken down. The issue is that they should stop running up and down and face the reason why the people gave them the mandate to govern.</p><p>“And if they do that, there will be no security issues; there will be no economic issues like hunger. I think that this is the most important thing,” the PDP Chairman said.</p><p>He also added that the National Assembly leadership is expected to declare the seats of legislators that cross from one party to the other vacant but they probably don’t understand the provision of the law in that regard.</p><p>In his words; “For the senators that have moved, we are convinced that it is illegal. The fault is from the leadership of the National Assembly.</p><p>“It was not supposed to be that way, but apparently, I don’t believe that the leadership of the National Assembly is looking at the books, at the constitution. If they do, they will not accept such a movement. This is again what the media should highlight.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5BpZmtoYmh6sbDPZqqpnZGgwG67zWaeoq6Zo7RuvNGeqqKclaPBqq3LZquim5uawW7AzmahqKaRqbWiuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-newhart-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Newhart and His Wife Ginnie Were Married for 60 Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./davido-gushes-over-ex-lover-chioma-as-he-gives-her-new-title.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Davido Gushes Over Ex-Lover Chioma, Gives Her New Title</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
