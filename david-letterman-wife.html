He began his television hosting career in 1982, and met his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Regina Lasko</a>, four years later. By the late 80s, David had become a prominent figure in late-night TV. Late Night with David Letterman aired after The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson. David later left his post at NBC, after losing the Tonight Show gig to Jay Leno, to host the Late Show with David Letterman on CBS.</p><p>David and Regina have been together throughout most of his talk show career.

The pair met in 1986 and quickly began a romantic relationship. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a>, Regina was a member of David’s staff, but she quit the show a few years after their relationship began. In 2009, the pair tied the knot after 23 years together.

In 2009, the comedian was the victim of a blackmail attempt that resulted in him making a public apology for cheating on his wife. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>, David had a romantic relationship with his former assistant, Stephanie Birkitt. She was dating CBS news producer Joe Halderman. Joe found out about the affair and demanded that David pay $2 million or be exposed for his indiscretions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Halderman was arrested for the extortion plot, and David fessed up to his affairs on his show. “My wife, Regina, she has been horribly hurt by my behavior,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David explained</a>. Regina hasn't publicly commented on the affair, but chose to stand by her man.</p><p>"I have no one to blame but myself," David said, during an appearance on Oprah’s Next Chapter (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>). “I think if you’re going to have a flow chart of the responsibility for this circumstance, this sex scandal, my name is at the top.”</p><p>Despite the cheating scandal, David and Regina’s relationship remained solid. The couple share one son, Harry, who was born in 2003.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Letterman’s son was the victim of a kidnapping plot.</h2><p>David and Regina's son was the target of a kidnapping plot in 2005. Kelly A. Frank, who was hired to paint David’s Montana ranch, concocted a plan to hold Harry for a $5 million ransom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a> reports. “The thought was to kidnap the nanny and the child so the nanny could take care of the child during this period of the kidnapping,” said the Montana Dept of Corrections. Harry was not harmed in the incident, and Kelly was arrested before he could execute his plan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These days, Harry spends his time in college.
