Here's what's going on with her and her spouse.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It looks like <a href=#>Mary-Kate Olsen is having a pretty rough quarantine</a>. Not only are she and husband Olivier Sarkozy going through a divorce that involves getting kicked out of her NYC apartment during a pandemic, but the emergency divorce filing Mary-Kate requested (to mitigate having all her things thrown out of their shared home) was officially denied. Evidently, the State Supreme Court doesn't consider the divorce filing "essential" right now.</p><p>Lucian Chalfen of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the New York Supreme Court</a> told CNN, "Only essential/emergency matters are allowed to be filed. The original filing was rejected by the New York County (Manhattan) clerk because they did not follow the essential matter procedure. They refiled under the essential matter procedure, and the matter was referred to an ex parte State Supreme Court Judge. He just decided that it is not essential, so they can't file anything at this point."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mary-Kate had filed the emergency documents because she allegedly tried filing them in April, but was unable to due to COVID-19 restrictions. She felt justified in filing the application this week because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the situation Olivier is putting her in</a>. According to Page Six, which was able obtain the filing, Mary-Kate claimed, "This application is an emergency because my husband expects me to move out of our home on Monday, May 18 2020 in the middle of New York City being on pause due to COVID-19."</p><p>It continues, "I am petrified that my husband is trying to deprive me of the home we have lived in and if he is successful, I will not only lose my home but I risk losing my personal property as well."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What exactly happened between Mary-Kate and her spouse, Olivier?</h2><p>Mary-Kate and Olivier had been married for almost five years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They reportedly met at a party in 2012 </a>and Mary-Kate was described as "immediately smitten" with him. After two years of dating, Olivier proposed to Mary-Kate and the two got married in France in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>The wedding ceremony and reception was absurdly private (no phones were allowed and they only had 50 guests.) However, one amusing detail did slip: According to a source, there were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"bowls and bowls" filled with cigarettes</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Mary-Kate and Olivier in 2012</p></figure><p>Many fans thought Olivier Sarkozy was an odd choice for the Full House actress. Olivier, who's a French banker and half-brother to Nicolas Sarkozy (the former President of France,) is 50 years old and was previously married with two children — making Mary-Kate a stepmom.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear when things started to sour between Mary-Kate and Olivier, but People reported that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce is due to them not "seeing eye-to-eye</a> on her career." A source told the outlet, "She's super career-focused and he's very French and wanted her to be more available. You can't control a girl who has been on the billionaire track since her 20s."&nbsp;</p><p>Nope, you certainly cannot. Mary-Kate and her twin sis, Ashley, run two high-end fashion brands, The Row and Elizabeth and James. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate's net worth </a>alone is estimated to be $250 million.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>A source told E! News that "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's gotten very ugly between [Mary-Kate and Olivier]</a>." They added that it's become a "heated divorce" and that "[Mary-Kate] is done with constant drama." Luckily, Mary-Kate's assets seem to be safe — she had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivier sign an "iron-clad" prenup</a> before they tied the knot.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>We do hope that Olivier doesn't toss Mary-Kate's things out of their apartment because, well, that's just childish. And nobody needs that during quarantine — life is hard enough these days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zxYykmK2dXaS5tLHNZqqpp6Wosg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-swanson-dad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Dad Is Basically Ron Swanson And Nick Offerman Agrees</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./16-feared-dead-as-gunmen-attack-benue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>16 Feared Dead As Gunmen Attack Benue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
