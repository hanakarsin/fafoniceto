The second installment of the 'AHS' spinoff is full of more horrific tales.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FX / Hulu</span></figure><p>When <a href=#>American Horror Story</a> fans were introduced to the show's first official spinoff, <a href=#>American Horror Stories</a>, it was what many needed to tide them over between seasons. The show features a different horrific story in each episode, or sometimes across two episodes, and it's like the adult version of Goosebumps or Are You Afraid of the Dark? that you never knew you needed.</p><p>But with the Season 2 premiere dropping on Hulu on July 21, 2022, fans are sure to wonder how many episodes American Horror Stories is. The first season spanned seven episodes, and each was more exciting than the last for longtime fans of the franchise.</p><p>Some of the episodes went back to recognizable AHS landmarks, while others started new lore altogether. And no matter how many episodes Season 2 of American Horror Stories is, viewers are going to want more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FX / Hulu</span><p>Dennis O'Hare in Season 2 of 'American Horror Stories.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many episodes is 'American Horror Stories' Season 2?</h2><p>Although Season 1 of American Horror Stories was seven episodes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 2 is eight</a>. It's not much more than the show's inaugural season, but it's better than a scaled-back batch of episodes at least. And something tells us that each of the eight episodes is going to full of the same horror and shock value that the rest of the franchise is known for.</p><p>Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, who created AHS together, also serve as executive producers on this show. And although it may be quite a few months before AHS Season 1 premieres, this is a nice stepping stone of horror for fans.</p><p>"Since 2011, the creators of the AHS have redefined the horror genre with various installments featuring a creepy asylum, a coven of witches, a traveling freak show, a haunted hotel and the apocalypse itself," FX said in a statement obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. "The television series sprouted a legion of dedicated fans who anticipate what terrors the next chapter will hold."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Step into darkness and feed your fears.

Among them were names like Paris Jackson, Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber, Cody Fern, and Matt Bomer. And Season 2 is following suit with big names attached to various episodes.</p><p>Season 2 of American Horror Stories features Dominique Jackson, Alicia Silverstone, Judith Light, Bella Thorne, and Quvenzhané Wallis, all for the first time. And now that they've all popped their AHS franchise cherry, it means we could see them in future seasons of the flagship show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FX / Hulu</span><p>Bella Thorne in 'American Horror Stories' Season 2.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How can you watch 'American Horror Stories'?</h2><p>AHS has always been an FX series. But American Horror Stories is available exclusively on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FX on Hulu</a>, thanks to FX's partnership with the streaming platform. The only downside is that it makes it a little more difficult for fans to get their fix if they aren't Hulu subscribers, but you can always sign up for a trial and then decide which Hulu plan suits your needs best.</p><p>Watch new episodes of American Horror Stories on Hulu starting on July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJllaW2tLvDnqpmoaNirq6x0aKamqZdnbyzvs6rZKysn6e2pr%2BMrJyaq5%2BjenM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billy-bean-vs-billy-beane.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billy Bean vs Billy Beane: Their Two Incredible Careers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./odd-future-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Odd Future - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
