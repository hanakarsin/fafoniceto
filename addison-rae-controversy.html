Despite being one of the most-followed influencers on the platform, she's been unusually absent from social media the last few days.</p><p>While some of her followers have been worried about her, wondering if she's <a href=#>pregnant</a> or <a href=#>in the hospital</a>, others are frustrated by her silence. Recently, previous social media posts from Addison have started circulating, and some think she's using her break from social media to avoid the <a href=#>controversy</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Addison do?</h2><p>A few of Addison's previous posts have come into question, countering her recent support of Black Lives Matter. The specific posts were outlined by YouTuber Daniella Perkins, in her video titled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming addison rae</a> ft. shawty the baddest."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In the video, she shares that Addison previously shared a YouTube video of a Black woman supporting All Lives Matter over Black Lives Matter. There's also a video of Addison whispering the n-word to her friend, fellow TikToker Kio Cyr, and a photo of her in dark makeup that some are saying is "blackfishing," or a form of Blackface.</p><p>"I love Addison. This video is not meant to hate on Addison in any way, shape, or form. I think she's a gorgeous girl. I think she's super talented. She has f--ked up though," Daniella said in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was a really big supporter of her and I'm kind of hurt by all of this stuff because I didn't know any of it and now I'm like, oh my god," Daniella said after outlining all of the controversial posts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Addison Rae is literally blackfishing. Are we not going to talk about that? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sH59J50l1M</a></p>â€” :) (@marie_kaseyyy) <a href=#>June 30, 2020</a></figure><p>Her biggest problem, though, is that Addison had remained silent about the posts, not addressing them as they came to light despite her recent posts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>"Addison, please just say something about everything that's going on about you," Daniella said. "Because at the end of the day, if you want to stay silent and you don't want to respond to drama, I get that, but at the end of the day, your supporters need to know that you support them. You have supporters of color, and they need to know you stand with them and you're fighting for their life."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>addison rae comes forward with an apology on twitter after being inactive on social media for a weekðŸ‘€</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Tiktok Shaderoom</a> (@tiktokroom) on Jul 8, 2020 at 1:09pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Addison finally breaks her silence.</h2><p>After a long break from social media, Addison recently returned to address her previous posts, releasing a statement that was shared by the drama Instagram account @tiktokroom.&nbsp;</p><p>"I owe all of you an apology," she wrote. "Four years ago, I reposted a video which included a woman sharing her thoughts on Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter that I should not have. Because of my privilege, I didn't understand and wasn't educated enough on the social injustices facing the Black community. All lives CANNOT matter until Black lives do. The Black community was and continues to be oppressed and damaged by systemic racism."</p><p>Addison continued the post, explaining that she plans to do better with her platform and understands why what she did was hurtful to some of her followers.</p><p>"I am truly sorry and I am committed to using the platform you all have given me to work on becoming a better ally. And I love you all endlessly," she concluded.</p><p><strong>If you are looking for ways to donate your time or money to Black Lives Matter and other antiracist organizations, we have created a</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>list of resources</strong></u></a> <strong>to get you started.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGltdKopWaqkZp6pLvNramorpWnwLo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./260493-how-ecitizen-certificate-good-conduct-kenya-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to get a Certificate of Good Conduct on eCitizen: Full guide</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-we-chartered-ethiopian-airlines-aircraft-nigerian-air-acting-md-confesses.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Why We Chartered Ethiopian Airlines Aircraft</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
