And in an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the Oct. 11 <a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a> reunion, he steps onto the stage for the first time as an interviewee rather than just one of the kids from the franchise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>In the clip, hosts Dr. Drew Pinsky and Nessa Diab speak to Bentley about his life outside of the show and his relationship with dad <a href=#>Ryan Edwards</a> now.

Since, as we see, it has helped his relationship with Ryan despite everything else going on in Ryan's life. And, mom Maci chimes in during the Teen Mom: The Next Chapter reunion clip, Bentley is "built different." In other words, Bentley's maturity is already shining through.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan's substance abuse struggles have caused issues in other areas of his life.</h2><p>Fans of Teen Mom are familiar with Ryan's struggles with substance abuse and subsequent drug-related arrests over the years. He also had a nasty and public falling out with estranged wife Mackenzie Edwards. However, while in the past, Ryan refused to film and even spoke poorly of Maci, the inaugural season of this particular Teen Mom spinoff proves things have changed considerably.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @bentleycedwards</a></figure><p>For the first time in a long time, Bentley and Ryan's relationship is strong and Ryan appears ready to do whatever it takes to be in his eldest son's life.
