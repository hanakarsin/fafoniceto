But Twitter user @Kane makes a strong case for "Asian Ron Swanson" as the best kind of dad. He might take you to an air reserve station instead of Disney World, but he will definitely make sure you know how to navigate without leaving a paper trail — or at the very least find your way out of IKEA without asking for directions.&nbsp;</p><p>In honor of Father's Day, Kane shared a couple dozen of the ways his dad embodies the Parks and Recreation man's man. Even Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman, would agree Kane's pops is every bit like his fictional character and sounds like a pretty awesome dad. END OF SPEECH.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>While Ron probably would not approve of Kane's dad's lack of mustache, this is not a contest about resembling Ron Swanson. This is about embodying the spirit of a man who not only knows how to paddle his own canoe, but how to fell a tree, hollow it, and fashion an oar to paddle it, all with his bare hands.</p><p>We'll use a five-steak rating system to evaluate each anecdote's Swansonity.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Ron Swanson would definitely insist on both using paper maps for orienteering and destroying your paper trail to avoid being tracked by enemies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>As Ron Swanson himself said, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don’t teach a man to fish and feed yourself. He’s a grown man, fishing’s not that hard.”&nbsp;</p><p>The only reason this is only 3 steaks is because it's about fish, not red meat. Fishing may be his yoga, but hunting is his true passion.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Now that's more like it. For one thing, it's resourceful and for another it involves meat. The only thing more Ron Swansony would be to build a separate shed on the property dedicated to just meat. Out of respect for the meat, of course.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This gets a full five steaks because it involves a big scary tool, in this case a cleaver, and in a distrust in large corporations and/or government lobbies. Plus I believe Ron would feel other kinds of knife were a little precious for his disposition.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>I'm not sure how Ron feels about dim sum but I absolutely know how he feels about waiting for food.

And if you made it whiskey, well then I reckon you'd have yourself a full 5 out of 5.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>I can also see Ron becoming fully kindred spirits with animals known to be unfriendly to the rest of the world. And I have to say, the blue jays in this story themselves are a bit Ron Swansony, in that they don't appreciate being made to wait for food.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong> 🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This is definitely weapons-grade Ron Swanson right here. As a government worker, he may not approve of the government as, like, a thing, but he'll agree that it's a great way to relax and get paid. "Am I interrupting anything important? Impossible. I work for the government."</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Now this is a sentiment after Ron Swanson's own heart. After all, it was he who said, "There is only one bad word: taxes."</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>If this were a trip to an America Woodworking Museum, this would for sure get 5 steaks. But, see, the military is run by the government. And we all know how Ron feels about government. His idea of a perfect government is "one guy who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke."</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score: </strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Ron Swanson cares not for your flashy status symbols. He cares about whether your watch is utilitarian. Clearly the chronometer on that watch is obsolete and poorl calibrated. Why would it be worth anything today?

Surely it didn't spontaneously catch fire out of poor maintenance but rather as a form of suicide. I'm so curious what the fire department discovered about the spontaneous combustion.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>While I'm certain Ron Swanson would appreciate the fact that Kane's dad is about self-sufficiency and repurposing perfectly good waste as fertilizer, he's made his feelings on vegetables very clear, and is very much against.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Now that's more like it. First, the fact that he is never without a personal supply of sausage is extremely Ron-like. That he has also converted his colleagues to his meat-stick craving ways is peak Swanson.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This is definitely how Ron would relate to kids if he spent much time with them, relating their cute games and interests to war games and man vs. wild scenarios.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Ron's not much of a smoker, but he probably knows a decent amount about Pawnee indigenous history, and would definitely be all about avoiding paying taxes on any good or service he could.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>You might be surprised I rated this one as low as I did, but Ron doesn't vote. Well, perhaps that's not 100 percent true, but he'd be more likely to write in Willie Nelson of Merle Haggard than vote for any major party, according to Nick Offerman.</p><p><strong>Swansonity Score:</strong>🥩🥩🥩</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">21.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Everything in life is a competition.
