Her biggest problem right now is her weight and getting to a number that would qualify her for bariatric surgery. But Tammy also wears oxygen almost around the clock, and some viewers are still a little confused about why.</p><p>Tammy hasn't always worn an oxygen mask or had a tank at her side. But in Season 2 of 1000-lb Sisters, she needed it. And since then, fans have noticed Tammy with oxygen tubes in her nose more often than not.</p><p>She was slammed by fans for vaping while on oxygen.

At the time, she was put on oxygen to help combat the respiratory effects of the virus. But after she recovered from COVID-19, she remained on oxygen. In November 2020, Tammy shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> video in which she explained that she wouldn't be on oxygen much longer, though we now know that was false.</p><p>"Yes, I'm on oxygen," she said at the time. "That's just to keep my lungs sturdy, strength â€” I won't be on [oxygen] much longer. I was on 15 liters of oxygen and now I'm on three."</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Thoracic Society</a>, some obese individuals have Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS). The condition is caused by low oxygen levels and too much carbon dioxide in the blood. It's possible that Tammy has OHS and requires continued use of oxygen now.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not Tammy using a vape pen on IG .. gurl arenâ€™t you on oxygen ðŸ˜¶ðŸ¤¨<a href=#>#1000lbSisters</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UfQdbBnRtI</a></p>â€” Janelle (@JanelleKendraa) <a href=#>November 23, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tammy has ongoing heath issues.</h2><p>Amy Slaton had weight loss surgery and recovered from a high-risk pregnancy on 1000-lb Sisters. Now, it's Tammy's health that has viewers constantly concerned. She wants to lose weight in order to get bariatric surgery. And after Tammy went to rehab for her food addiction, things seemed to improve for her.</p><p>However, her weight, lack of movement, and general food and health habits still stand in Tammy's way of developing a permanently healthier lifestyle. Amy explains on the show that if Tammy doesn't exercise or at least walk more, she could become bedridden. And Amy says in the Nov. 29, 2021, episode that the next step after that is "death."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tammy should have stayed in that damn rehab until she was off that dang oxygen <a href=#>#1000lbsisters</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5jjTSSoxjW</a></p>â€” thewordgallerybyL (@thewordgalleryL) <a href=#>November 16, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Tammy get weight loss surgery?</h2><p>Tammy still has not gotten <a href=#>weight loss surgery</a>.
