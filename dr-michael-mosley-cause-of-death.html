Here's what we know about why Michael went missing and what his cause of death could be.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What was Dr. Michael Mosley's cause of death?</h2><p>After Michael's body was found, police officials said that a coroner ruled out foul play, but couldn't determine what his cause of death was. His body was transferred to the Dodecanese island of Rhodes, where more tests will be done.</p><p>Michael's body was found on the island of Symi, and the deputy mayor there confirmed that the body that had been found was "certainly" his.</p><p>"It's devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind, and brilliant husband," Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley, Michael's wife, said in a statement. "We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much."</p><p>The body was first discovered after Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas, journalists from state TV channel ERT and others filmed the area from a vessel.</p><p>Michael's body was found lying face up with his head on a rock.</p><p>While his cause of death may still be uncertain, it seems clear that Michael died as a result of some sort of accident while he was on his walk. The news of his death is undoubtedly a tragic end, but one that many had likely suspected after days of searching didn't uncover his actual whereabouts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr Michael Mosley (@michaelmosley_official)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Michael hosted a number of shows in the U.K.</h2><p>Michael was best known for hosting several BBC series on biology and medicine, including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor and The One Show.

Following the news of his death, fans who had followed his career offered remembrances about him on his Instagram account.</p><p>"Absolutely devastated to hear the news this morning," one person wrote. "I don't know why it's touched me so much but I've been in tears. I think because he was such a combination of talent, positivity, empathy for people as well as clearly a very insightful clinical researcher and pioneer bringing insights about the microbiome and metabolic health to the mainstream. RIP dearest Michael. Thank you for everything."</p><p>"I think everyone has been holding our breath this week, hoping for a good outcome," another person added. "So sad to lose a national treasure, he’s been instrumental in changing my health decisions for a long time now. I can’t believe he’s gone, he will be greatly missed.
