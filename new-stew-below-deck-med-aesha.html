Proceed with caution.</strong></p><p>For die-hard fans of <a href=#>Below Deck Med</a>, summer 2020's Season 5 is providing everything we could ever have wished for from a reality television series —&nbsp;and then some.</p><p>The drama abounds and we can hardly keep up with the current and forthcoming cast changes!</p><p><a href=#>Is Chef Kiko leaving</a>? <a href=#>When will Hannah get fired</a>? Does it have to do with the pills she's taking? <a href=#>Will Bugsy be promoted to Chief Stew</a>? And if so, who will be her new second stew? All of these questions are currently top of mind for Bravo audiences, and we're here to dig IN.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It looks like there will be yet another crew change in store for The Wellington.</h2><p>For a little bit of background, the season started off with <a href=#>Lara Flumiani</a>, Jessica More and Chief Stew Hannah Ferrier in the interior, but things went horribly awry between Lara and Hannah, and the former ended up quitting the charter season early on.</p><p>This unexpected shift in crew left Hannah in need of a second stew replacement, which led Captain Sandy Yawn to call in Season 2's Christine "Bugsy" Drake, with whom Hannah had beef with ever since the last time they worked together.</p><p>It's been about a month now that Bugsy has been on the show, and she's been going above and beyond the call of duty to not only create show-stopping tablescapes, but also make sure everything runs smoothly on the interior — even when that means stepping up to manage Jessica when Hannah fails to delegate duties within her team.</p><p>All of this makes sense to superfans of the Below Deck franchise who know that <a href=#>Hannah Ferrier is set to get fired</a> from the series at some point in the season. In fact, production has been focusing on every single time Hannah takes a pill, leading many of us to wonder whether the drugs the crew finds in the trailer for the season actually belongs to the Chief Stew.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But if Hannah gets fired, who will be the new stew?</h2><p>So, to recap: Hannah is going to get fired, Bugsy will naturally be promoted and manage the whole interior (evidenced by how she and the captain stress that Chief Stew is her title and that Bugsy only took the Second Stew position on the Wellington as a favor to the captain).</p><p>Kiko will probably end up leaving in solidarity with Hannah, and then either Jessica will be promoted to second, or else, someone else will have to step up to the plate. Luckily for you, dear reader, we have an idea of who that is! And get this: it's a familiar face!</p><p><a href=#>Aesha Scott</a> is returning to Below Deck Med!</p><p>You read that right! The beloved stew, who many viewers call the absolute best reality personality ever to grace television, is about to make her return.</p><p>While many initially speculated that she might be coming in as second stew to replace Lara, it appears Season 4's Aesha will actually join the team following Hannah's departure.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, if this is legit, they couldn't just NOT rehire Hannah, They had to contrive a way to bring back Bugsy and then fire Hannah in the most degrading way, promote Bugsy and bring back Aesha. <a href=#>#BelowDeckMed</a> <a href=#>#BelowDeck</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KA2PBfQVIb</a></p>— Leila Mcgregor (@LeilaMcGregor) <a href=#>June 30, 2020</a></figure><p>First came <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this photo</a> that began circulating in some fan circles on reddit, which was followed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another photo</a> of Aesha, Malia, Bugsy, Jessica, and an unknown male cast member, who many are saying is Malia's chef boyfriend and replacement to Kiko.</p><p>Plus, six months ago, a superfan on the Below Deck subreddit found an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram comment where Aesha hinted </a>she would be on the upcoming Below Deck Med season, but couldn't "say too much yet."</p><p>The yachtie <a href=#>is no longer dating Jack Stirrup</a>, with whom she connected on the season, and has a new man in her life: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scotty Dobbo.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Just when we thought the season of Below Deck Med couldn't get any better, we cannot wait to welcome this New Zealander back to the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7K4edKtnLBlkpq5sMOMnZyco12isqV5wJ6qoZk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-fauci-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Anthony Fauci Announces He Will Step Down From Government Service</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened Between Woah Vicky and Chrisean Rock?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
