But what is the "Oops!... I Did It Again" music video guy doing now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"Oops! ... I Did It Again" is among <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>' most iconic singles — and the accompanying video was pretty epic, too. The 2000 masterpiece featured at 19-year-old Britney as a sexy alien serenading a hunky astronaut. And who could forget when that astronaut took off his helmet and then gifted Britney the Titanic necklace?&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It went a little something like this</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>"Britney, before you go there's something I want you to have," the hot astronaut said.</p><p>"Oh, it's beautiful," Brit exclaimed. "But wait a minute, isn't this ..?"</p><p>"Yeah. Yes, it is," he replied while flashing those swoon-worthy dimples and handing over the Heart of the Ocean necklace.</p><p>"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean at the end?"</p><p>"Well baby, I jumped in and got it for you," he declared.</p><p>"Aw, you shouldn't have."</p><p>It's been 20 years since this moment, for the record. (Mind = blown.) So what is the "Oops... I Did It Again" music video guy doing now? Let's investigate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The astronaut in the "Oops!... I Did It Again" music video is Eli Swanson.</h2><p>Eli was a model at the time he appeared in the music video for "Oops!... I Did It Again." He worked for brands like Nike, Adidas, and Ralph Lauren in the early 2000s. Here's Eli at a premiere party for the Nintendo GameCube back in 2001. (Has it really been that long?)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although he will forever be that hot, dimpled guy from the "Oops!... I Did It Again" music video, Eli is much more than a pretty face. This is evident by the fact that his career path has taken a drastic turn — from model to doctor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The "Oops!... I Did It Again" music video guy is now a surgeon.</h2><p>Yes, you read that correctly. It turns out Eli, who is currently 44, is now an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">orthopedic surgeon in Georgia</a>.</p><p>In 20016, Eli graduated from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. This was<strong> </strong>followed by an internship and a residency at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, as well as a fellowship at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He has been a practicing surgeon for eight years now, And it certainly seems that he knows his stuff.</p><p>"As an Orthopedic surgeon specializing in the treatment of complex fractures I believe that it is important for the doctor patient relationship to allow a clear line of communication to exist where the patient has a clear understanding of what their diagnosis is as well as what their treatment plan consists of," his bio reads on HealthGrades.com</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: District Medical Group</span></figure><p>It continued, "Recovering from a traumatic injury is difficult and I am honored to be able to assist in that recovery process whether it be surgical or non surgical treatment."</p><p>So, yeah. If you happen to be in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpharetta, Ga., area</a> and you suffer a bone fracture, definitely consider giving Dr. Eli Swanson a call. Because his expertise (and adorable dimples) will surely have you on the mend in no time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLyxv4yiZJ2hlGK2tXnAoJiipl2iwrS1wmatopyVpHqowdhmpaiv</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./terry-bradshaw-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Movies Is Terry Bradshaw In?
