Hailed as the giant of Washington D.C. journalism, he pioneered a people-centered approach and an exemplary work ethic.</p><p>Applauded for his rare ability to give voice to the members of the local community, Bruce became a source of inspiration for many. He authored several books, including Surviving Deep Waters. What happened to Bruce? What's his cause of death?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/WUSA 9</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bruce Johnson tragically died in April 2022. Here's what you should know about the tragedy — including the cause of death.</h2><p>Greatly loved by his colleagues, viewers, and the inhabitants of Washington, D.C., and beyond, Bruce cemented himself as an influential and inspiring journalist, news anchor, and author. He worked as a reporter and anchor for WUSA9 for more than four decades, first joining the channel in 1976. A role model for many, Bruce will long be remembered for his dedication to his craft and incredible kindness.</p><p>Bruce's cause of death is heart failure. Bruce suffered a severe heart attack in 1992, at only 42 years old. As part of the recovery process, he partook in the Marine Corps Marathon, a 26.2-mile marathon held every year in Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Va. He wrote the 2009 book, Heart to Heart, to cast light on the stories of heart attack survivors.</p><p>Bruce was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma a few years ago, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>. He took time off work to undergo chemotherapy, announcing his retirement in 2020. Bruce's autobiography, Surviving Deep Waters, came out in February 2022.</p><p>A tireless journalist and writer, Bruce was committed to amplifying the voices of everyday people, using his charisma and kindness to elevate his co-workers, interview subjects, and many others.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"I am so heartbroken. … Bruce Johnson was one of a kind.
