Bean was diagnosed with leukemia back in September 2023, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB</a>.</p><p>The second former major league player to <a href=#>come out as gay</a>, Bean went on to become the MLB's senior VP for <a href=#>diversity, equity, and inclusion (commonly known as DEI).</a></p><p>Another well-known figure in the sports world is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Beane</a> (note the extra "e" at the end of his last name), who is two years older than Billy Bean and also used to play baseball. He is the former general manager of the Oakland Athletics and current senior adviser to the team's owner John Fisher, and he previously played for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and, of course, the Athletics.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague Billy Bean, MLB’s Senior VP for Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion and Special Assistant to the Commissioner.

"He made baseball a better institution, both on and off the field, by the power of his example, his empathy, his communication skills, his deep relationships inside and outside our sport, and his commitment to doing the right thing."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When did Billy Bean retire from professional baseball?</h2><p>Billy Bean's last MLB game was in 1989. He retired at the age of 31, deciding to step away from the game after realizing "that living as a closeted baseball player was untenable," according to the MLB. Because Billy felt it wasn't the right moment to come out as a gay player, he waited more than three years to share his true self with the world.</p><p>Glenn Burke was the first MLB player to come out as gay, having followed a similar timeline as Billy (retiring in 1979 and coming out three years later).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7atuNhmmZ6ZnmLDtHnBoqOlsV2XsqK6xA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-slater-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher John Slater - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-episodes-is-american-horror-stories-season-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'American Horror Stories' Season 2 Is Like 'Goosebumps' For Adults</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
