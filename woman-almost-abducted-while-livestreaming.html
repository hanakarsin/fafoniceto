The clip begins innocently as Courtney is examining her packages before shipping them.

Courtney then offers to take the woman home and then the encounter gets weird.</p><p>The video cuts to Courtney having a conversation with the woman and suggests that the woman contact a highway patrol officer to help her find her way home. Courtney continues to ask the woman where she was coming from but wasn't able to get additional information. The woman simply repeated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lost.‚Äù</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>A police officer then entered the building, but it isn't clear who contacted the authorities.
