Ginnie and Bob quickly became close and eventually married in January 1963.</p><p>"Buddy came back one day and said in his own inimitable way, ‘I met this young guy and his name is Bobby Newhart, and he’s a comic, and he’s Catholic and you’re Catholic, and I think maybe you should marry each other,'" Ginnie said in an interview. "I was 20 [or] 21and I think Bob was 32."</p><p>In 2023, just a few months after the couple celebrated their 60th anniversary, Ginnie passed away at their home in Century City after a long illness.
