Now, he’s making music too! In September of 2023, he teased his song “Chrome Hearted” — and social media dubbed it a certified bop. The track got even more traction when people determined that the song was supposedly a jab at his ex <a href=#>Nessa Barrett</a>.</p><p>So, what’s the true meaning behind the lyrics of “Chrome Hearted”?

But it was the hook that really got the people going.</p><p>“She’s chrome-hearted, her love life’s erotic, yeah / She’s so obsessed with herself,” he sings in the hook. And the crowd went wild.</p><p>While we can’t confirm it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@teatoktalk</a> claimed that Nessa’s new boyfriend, Harley Solomon, is Richard and Laurie Lynn Stark’s nephew. Who are these people, you ask?

But they didn’t tell their fans until a month later.</p><p>According to Nessa, it was because of the backlash that they ultimately split.</p><p>"It was something that made me really upset because, at the time, I thought it was doing something that would make me happy,” she told Alex Cooper in an episode of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Call Her Daddy</a> podcast.</p><p>“But at the same time, I had the whole world calling me a s--t and a backstabbing b---h, and a homie hopper, and a home wrecker.
