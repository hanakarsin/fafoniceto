The former model became infamous for her stance on vaccines in 2008 when she appeared on Larry King Live and claimed that vaccines are proven to cause autism (this isn't true). When people aren't talking about her dangerous pseudo science, they're talking about her alleged plastic surgery and looks. Especially lately, Jenny's got some really, really white, straight teeth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jenny's teeth are so blindingly white and perfect, that people are wondering if they're fake.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Jenny McCarthy do to her teeth?</h2><p>While Jenny McCarthy hasn't publicly addressed that she altered her teeth in any way, it's likely that she got veneers — a common procedure done amongst celebs who want a perfect smile. Even braces can't always fix slightly uneven teeth, so people get veneers to get a more symmetrical smile. It seems like Jenny went to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dr. Dean Lodding</a>, an Illinois-based dentist who offers cosmetic dentistry.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is nothing "wrong" with Jenny's natural teeth, it does seem like they're slightly uneven (and certainly not so artificially bright). In a video she posted to Instagram exactly one year ago, you can see what her teeth (probably) look like unaltered.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This is what her teeth look like now. They're definitely much whiter and more symmetrical.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While Jenny hasn't talked about her teeth before, she has admitted she's a fan of Botox — so she's not above cosmetic alterations to her looks and appearance. <a href=# rel=nofollow>She told Michigan Avenue</a>, "I think plastic surgery is fun if it makes you feel good. I love Botox, I absolutely love it. I get it minimally, so I can still move my face. But I really do think it’s a savior.” She added, "I'm all for looking better, so I plan on doing whatever I want when the time comes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She's also likely had other work done. “Jenny McCarthy is a great example of how to maintain your looks over the years. In my opinion, she has had facial fillers done in her jaw line, cheeks, and mid face," Aesthetic Injector&nbsp;Kristina Kitsos<a href=# rel=nofollow> told Radar Online</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She explained, “As we age, our facial bones actually decrease in size over the years. As a result, the face droops and sags. With balanced and precise injections of certain robust fillers directly on the facial bones, you can prevent the inevitable drooping and sagging of the face and maintain a taut, youthful facial structure.”</p><p>All that work cost the show host a pretty penny. “Jenny has had great work done and I suspect that she has gone to very skilled providers. All in all, this work would cost around $50,000 to $60,000," Kristina estimated. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Veneers can cost</a> anywhere from $400 to $2,500 a tooth, depending on if you get the porcelain or composite variety. Considering <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jenny's net worth</a> is somewhere around $25 million (this is an estimated number), we're guessing she can afford the procedure just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lmpq7r8WMppqcmaKptbp5w6hkraddnbKzedOenK2g</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1291711-car-tupac-shot-auctioned-n634m-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Car Tupac was shot in is being auctioned for N634m</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-avengers-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Avengers - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
