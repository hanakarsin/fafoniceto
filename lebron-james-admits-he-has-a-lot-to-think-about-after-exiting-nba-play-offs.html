I don’t know.</p><p>“I’ve got a lot to think about, to be honest.”</p><p>LeBron James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s illustrious record of 38,387 points set in 1989 in February 2023, becoming the NBA’s all-time greatest scorer.</p><p>But following Monday’s loss, in which he finished with 40 points, 10 rebounds, and 9 assists after scoring 31 points in the first half, he called the season “challenging”.</p><p>“I don’t know. I think it was OK. I don’t like to say it’s a successful year because I don’t play for anything besides winning championships at this point in my career,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t get a kick out of making a conference [finals] appearance. I’ve done it, a lot. And it’s not fun to me to not be able to be a part of getting to the Finals.</p><p>“For me, it’s all about availability and keeping my mind sharp and things of that nature, being present on the floor, being present in the locker room and bus rides and plane rides, things of that nature. It’s challenging.</p><p>“But we’ll see. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens going forward.”</p><p>James extended his contract with the Lakers by two years in August 2022, keeping him with the team through the 2024–2025 campaign.</p><p>He has long said that he wants to continue playing so that he might face off against or play with his oldest son Bronny, who will play collegiate basketball at the University of Southern California next year and who might make the NBA in time for the 2024–2025 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5FtZqWdkqe8r3nJmqSeq12Wsa6106xkoZ1dna60ecBmo6isXam8bsDHoqWkZZGXvLbAjJqdrZ2iYrK5tdOipaBlnpeubrzLmrBmp5abwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./312953-lawyers-beautiful-graduate-wife-sells-a-wheelbarrow-explains-why-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet beautiful lawyer's wife hawking meals using wheelbarrow</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./12469-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ghanian songstress Efya drops new video Getaway</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
