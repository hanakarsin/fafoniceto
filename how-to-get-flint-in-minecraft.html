Here's how.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | Flascoe</span></figure><p>One of the most engaging/addictive elements of <a href=#>Minecraft</a> is the fact that there's just so much to do in the title. You can raise animals, make little in-game computers and mess around with cheats, uncover hidden lands, and engage in a slew of story missions that you can add into the game. But the heart of the gameplay lies in the title's, er, title itself: mining and crafting. This is accomplished by getting your hands on a variety of different raw materials — like flint — in the game.</p><p>Here's how to get your boxy little hands on some flint.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get flint in 'Minecraft.'</h2><p>First off: What is flint? It's not just a town in Michigan or something you use to start a fire on a survivalist game show; it's a material you use in Minecraft to make flint and steel and arrows.</p><p>You can obtain flint by mining gravel, but there's only a 10% chance that when you crack a gravel brick open it'll drop flint instead of a chunk of the stone.</p><p>But there's a way to up those percentages, as that 1/10 metric only applies whenever you're mining around without an enchanted tool. But you can add Fortune enchantments to up those percentages, and here's a breakdown of how much more of a chance you'll have at mining flint if you add these <a href=#>enchantments</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | Flascoe</span></figure><p>Fortune 1: 14%</p><p>Fortune 2: 25%</p><p>Fortune 3: 100%</p><p>Yeah, that's right, if you can get the Fortune 3 enchantment on your mining tool, then you're going to have a very, very easy time of securing yourself all of the flint that you want in Minecraft.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bro I was playing Minecraft and I cleared a huge plot of gravel for about five in-game days.

Putting together "flint and steel" is about as straightforward as it sounds: get one unit of flint and one iron unit in the crafting grid and voilà.</p><p>Of course, you could always trade for flint with villagers or just try to mine it the old-fashioned way without enchantments, but if you're trying to get a lot of it more quickly, get those fortune enchantments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKzrbXNrWSipl2itq%2BxwquYn6w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-taylor-1995-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Russell Taylor - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./switzerland-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Switzerland | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
