Is he still making people laugh with his <a href=#>special brand of stand-up comedy</a>? Read on for an update on what he's up to now and if fans still have the opportunity to see the funnyman in action.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, where is Daniel Tosh now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Daniel has an active following on Instagram, and still shares clips from his show, Tosh.0. Judging from the comments, loyal fans miss the comedian.</p><p>However, the show, which poked fun of people behaving badly, didn't sit well with everyone. One commenter opined on a throwback clip, "Your show is a great example of why culture is stuck in a sewer."</p><p>The star of the defunct series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> at the time, "I look forward to doing an animated reboot of my show on MTV in 25 years."</p><p>Daniel also tweeted in reaction, "After 12 years together, Comedy Central and I are consciously uncoupling. They get the cartoons, and I'm heading to any network with stronger WiFi."</p><p>But Daniel has certainly kept busy since moving on from his show. Not only does the jokester have 1 million <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> followers, but he has a full schedule of shows on his 2023 tour.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Daniel Tosh is on tour and yes, you can see him live —&nbsp;as well as on an upcoming TV show.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>today is the day! tickets to my new stand-up tour go on sale now! loosen up your bible belts! <a href=#>#sweetTtour</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/ScSZPJ2qdQ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cfpqNWh9do</a></p>— daniel tosh (@danieltosh) <a href=#>May 12, 2023</a></figure><p>According to Daniel's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, he will be touring across the country from June through November 2023.</p><p>Fans can see the comedian on his stops from California, to Las Vegas, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, to name a few.</p><p>But Daniel is also set to host a new show that seeks to find the greatest reality stars of all time — which we will so be watching. The GOAT will air on <a href=#>Amazon Freevee</a>. While we don't know yet when the highly-anticipated series will premiere, we do have some info on what fans can expect.</p><p>“The show will feature some of the buzziest names from the last 25 years of reality television, who will take up residence in GOAT Manor, where they will face a series of mental, physical, and social challenges,” a press release <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> about the show. “Fourteen will enter, but only one will win the cash prize and America’s respect as they claim the coveted GOAT title.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not calling him the GOAT, but I do almost always enjoy Daniel Tosh.</p>— FinsUp Adam (@awilhelm1528) <a href=#>November 10, 2022</a></figure><p>Ironically, many fans consider Daniel to the GOAT of the comedy world. The upcoming show will star reality stars from <a href=#>Tayshia Adams of The Bachelor</a> fame, to <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules alum Kristen Doute</a>, to Real Housewives OG <a href=#>Jill Zarin</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Daniel keeps his private life just that.</h2><p>In addition to his busy touring schedule and filming The GOAT, Daniel has been married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carly Hallam</a> since 2016.
