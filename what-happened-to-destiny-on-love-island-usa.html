And Season 5 of <a href=#>Love Island USA</a> is proving to be just as eventful as previous iterations of the dating show. The series, which airs on USA and streams on Peacock, follows a group of 10 contestants as they vie for a chance to win $100,000. Players on the show must remain coupled to avoid elimination. However, for <a href=#>Destiny Davis</a>, finding a consistent partner has proven to be difficult.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Destiny joined the popular dating series for Season 5 and was first paired with <a href=#>Marco Donatelli</a>. The self-proclaimed “alpha dater” makes no secret of her demands from a potential partner, while Marco has openly admitted to being “a party boy.” After five days together, the two decided to find new partners and Destiny chose to pair with Harrison Luna. Harrison was one of the newcomers to the villa, after joining the show on Day 5.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Harrison's coupling with Destiny lasted longer than her time with Marco, the pair got off to a rocky start. During a game of Truth or Dare, Harrison was dared to partake in a three-way kiss with two contestants of his choosing. He picked Destiny and Anna Kurdy, but Destiny wasn't willing to join the act. Fans of the show then took to social media to suggest that Destiny was a “prude” for refusing to participate in the game.</p><p>Now, Destiny is involved in more drama despite finding a new pair.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Destiny on 'Love Island USA'?</h2><p>The drama surrounding Destiny on Love Island USA continues, as viewers express concern about her behavior on the reality show. Destiny is a microbiologist in St. Louis, Mo., who never hesitates to stand firm in her beliefs. However, Destiny’s brash personality has caused a rift in her relationship with her latest new partner.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>After unsuccessfully coupling with Marco and Harrison, Destiny paired up with Jonah Allman. Unfortunately, their union was short-lived as well. Destiny later switched couples and was paired with Mike Stark, and eventually Isiah "Zay" Harayda. Destiny and Zay seemed destined for relationship bliss until an incident during movie night caused Destiny to break down. During the event, a clip showing Mike with another contestant was played. After Destiny — who previously had feelings for Mike — expressed her grief, she got into an explosive argument with Zay.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zay accused Destiny of having feelings for Mike.</h2><p>Zay wasted no time telling Destiny how he felt about her openly expressing her disdain for Mike’s relationship with Hannah Ortega. Needless to say, they didn't agree on the matter.</p><p>“What is the purpose of you being so concerned about the whole situation with Mike?” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zay asked</a>. Adding, “This is so embarrassing to me.” Destiny went on to explain that she simply wanted “closure,” and admitted that she would rather have settled her difference with Mike in private. Zay then attempted to explain how the moment made him feel, but Destiny wasn't willing to hear him out. “I don’t care,” she yelled before storming away.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans</a> of the show are calling for Destiny to leave the villa as some are suggesting that she was dismissive of Zay’s feelings during their argument.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdnaOptq%2FFjKilZqSfq7JutdKlmKecXarAog%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mat-shaw-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mat Shaw - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uk-govt-sanctions-roman-abramovich-stops-chelsea-sale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UK Govt Sanctions Roman Abramovich, Stops Chelsea Sale</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
