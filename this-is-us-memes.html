After six seasons full of the most brilliant writing and incredible performances (shout-out to <a href=#>Mandy Moore</a>), we don't want to say goodbye to the hit NBC drama.</p><p>Our time with the Pearson clan is rapidly dwindling down, and we can't help but feel melancholic — this fictional family has such a massive place in our hearts, so never seeing them on our TV screens again makes us quite sad.</p><p>But, enough of that; we're here to honor the show's legacy, and what better way to do that than through memes. Here are 10 of our favorites!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Jezebel via TheThings</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The writers always know how to tie everything together — genius!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me at the beginning of the ep: who the hell are these people<br>me at the end: oh they are my FAMILY and i would DIE for them ok <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a></p>— lexie & jessica chastain 13 (@inllewyndavis) <a href=#>September 25, 2019</a></figure><p>Clearly, the Season 4 premiere of This Is Us was titled "Strangers" for a reason.</p><p>Throughout most of the episode, viewers followed the life of a young blind musician; as a result, fans were baffled at who the heck this man was until the end confirmed he's <a href=#>Kate and Toby</a>'s son, Jack. Talk about iconic storytelling!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's safe to say we were all screaming and crying at this scene.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kate: The dog dad<br>Jack: I will go get it<br>Me:<a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0rVVJCJCZ7</a></p>— Malvado (@Spunkyyy_) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><p>Although we consider ourselves to be some of the biggest <a href=#>animal lovers</a> in the entire world, once Jack went back into the house to save the dog, we knew things weren't looking too good for him. Ugh, we're tearing up just writing this!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Literally every 'This Is Us' fan since Sept. 20, 2016.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me preparing for the end of tonight’s episode of <a href=#>#thisisus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pgx8ez47aU</a></p>— kiki (@halpertsimms) <a href=#>May 18, 2022</a></figure><p>This one tweet sums up the entire viewing experience of This Is Us. We know every single episode will shatter our hearts into millions of pieces, but we don't care because it's just that good of a show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We're a simple fanbase: We see William, and we immediately start crying.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fact that William is her guide <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/awzQDjq3Jk</a></p>— Dana (@xodana_) <a href=#>May 18, 2022</a></figure><p>Anytime William comes back, we can't help but let the tears stream down our faces; however, we really let them flow once we learned he would be the one to guide Rebecca into the afterlife. Yet again, we're crying just writing this!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who knew a show could up its emotional level with every episode?!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Last week’s episode: You’ve never cried harder during an episode.</p><p>This week’s episode: Hold my beer.</p><p>Next week’s episode: You should probably find a therapist.</p><p>Final episode: You’re gonna need to call into work tomorrow.<a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>#ThisIsUsFinalChapter</a></p>— Carrie Hahn (@KSgirlCarrie) <a href=#>May 11, 2022</a></figure><p>Week after week, This Is Us finds new ways to break our hearts. While there are several big moments that call for tearful reactions, there are small ones too that we can't help but get emotional over (yes, we're referencing hot dogs and tomato soup).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"I think I've seen this film before, and I didn't like the ending."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why did we have to relive Jack dying?

It's just cruel, and the show will be hearing from our therapists.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Since 2018, the word "Crockpot" has become a trigger for us.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me watching the crockpot bring it all together <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XZOS4rXjdl</a></p>— Katrina Savaglio (@SavaglioKatrina) <a href=#>January 24, 2018</a></figure><p>Jack Pearson didn't serve our country and survive a hostile household only to die at the hands of a freaking Crockpot.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jack Pearson is the reason why we have such high standards.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just want someone to love me the way Jack loves Rebecca <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LVGODVH5q3</a></p>— kins (@ivanskulti) <a href=#>March 15, 2017</a></figure><p>Jack Pearson: making all husbands and fathers look bad every Tuesday night since 2016. OK, but in all honesty, Jack really is the ideal partner, and we hope to find someone half as good as him someday.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This was, without a doubt, the most brutal fight in 'This Is Us' history.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kevin n randall physically fighting each other would’ve hurt less than seeing them say all that to one another god DAMN <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xSgPY3ONyr</a></p>— × (@skrullsharon) <a href=#>March 25, 2020</a></figure><p>We don't even want to relive this fight because it was ugly. Not only did Randall tell Kevin that their father died ashamed of him, but Kevin said the worst thing that ever happened to him was the day Rebecca and Jack brought Randall home ... ouch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Our tear ducts exploded after this emotional 'This Is Us' reunion.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>rebecca and jack together again after all these years!!! <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eDDezimUyu</a></p>— nikki (@haIsteadsass) <a href=#>May 18, 2022</a></figure><p>Though we could barely see through our tears, we managed to catch the beautiful reunion between Jack and Rebecca in the afterlife.
