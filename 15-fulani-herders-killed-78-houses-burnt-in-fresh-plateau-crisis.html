About 78 houses were burnt down. Cattle numbering 2,000 are still missing. This unfortunate thing is moving its head quickly into other LGAs of the state to annihilate Fulani completely in the state,”&nbsp;Abdullahi told Daily Trust.</p><p>He further alleged a fresh plan to attack their communities by suspected militias.</p><p>“There is an intelligence report that there are trained militias recruited and brought to fight and chase all Fulani out of Plateau State in the name of crisis. Therefore, at this point, we are still calling on the federal government to as a matter of urgency put a stop to what is happening in Mangu LGA.</p><p>“They should take immediate action before things go out of hand. We are soliciting the FG to take necessary action so that things will not go out of hand. We will not continue watching people killing us and destroying our properties,” the MACBAN chairman said.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that a there have been a series of attacks in Mangu and other communities of the state recently.</p><p>Not fewer than 200 people have been confirmed killed, including women and children in the last few months. In a bid to contain the situation earlier, Plateau State Governor, <strong>Caleb Mutfwang, </strong>imposed a 24-hour curfew on Mangu LGA.</p><p>In a statement made available to newsmen, the Director of Press and Public Affairs, <strong>Gyang Bere</strong>, said the governor imposed the curfew following his consultation with the State Security Council.</p><p>The statement said movements within the local government have been banned until further notice except for security personnel and persons on essential duties, adding that security agencies have been directed to ensure total enforcement of the curfew.</p><p>The governor assured that his government was working round-the-clock to restore peace and security in the state.</p><p>However, as of reporting time, the state police command is yet to issue an official statement on the latest attack claimed by MACBAN,<strong> Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BpZmptXZvCra3NomShnaKZsrO%2FjKSgpaSVmXp4hIyhpq6rlah6o8HRp6tmoZ5is7Ox0qFkqaSRqbKiwYycqaKrmah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./25-year-old-mohammed-suleiman-emerges-as-pdp-national-youth-leader.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>25-year-old Muhammed Suleiman Emerges As PDP National Youth Leader</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./youtube-error-429.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>YouTube's Error 429 Is Frustrating Users: Here's What It Means</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
