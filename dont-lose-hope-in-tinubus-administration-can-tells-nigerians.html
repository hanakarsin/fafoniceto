He’s aware, and we see him making very positive steps, even from the beginning of his administration.</p><p>“By the way he has made appointments so far, he has come with a great sense of inclusiveness. And Nigerians have a sense of belonging.</p><p>“I tell you that his pronouncements so far and his body language have increased the confidence of Nigerians, and we believe that, given the chance, he will do a lot more. We are praying that the Lord will strengthen his hand to be able to do more and turn around the fortunes of this country.”</p><p>Okoh appealed for understanding from Nigerians, arguing that the challenges affecting the country existed before the current administration took office.</p><p>He noted, “We know that there are a lot of challenges. But what we tell our people is that this is just the beginning of this administration, and Nigeria is big.</p><p>“What we face now started many years back, and it will take a while to turn around these things.</p><p>“But the important thing is that there is an intentional step that the President has taken and is taking to reverse the trend of events, especially in the area of governance; we see it very clearly.”</p><p>“The advice we have for the President is for him to continue on the path that he is now determined to follow.</p><p>“He is determined to run a government that is for all, an all-inclusive government, that listens to the people, just like he made a pledge to us that he will continue to listen to us and he has opened the channels for us that anything that we see or any concern that we have, we should always come back to let him know.</p><p>“So we believe that now we have a listening president. And we urge him to continue on that path. And to continue to always look out for those who mean well for this nation and put them to good use,” Okoh advised.</p><p>The Christian body stated that its presence at the seat of power was to congratulate the President on his electoral victory.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the 2023 general elections, the leadership of CAN decided to pay a courtesy visit to express congratulations to President Tinubu and to pledge their support for his administration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FrZp2nnql6rbvSnmShp6Caeqq6jK2gp62SqsBurcOmoKeho6m%2FosDIqKVmm5GjerWxy6WqZqaZnLKztcCnqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flutterwave-breaks-new-record-now-valued-above-3bn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Flutterwave Breaks New Record, Now Valued Above $3bn</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-ruivivar-ncis-hawaii.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Ruivivar Is Joining 'NCIS: Hawaii' Who Is This EXcellent Addition?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
