Is Ashton leaving 5SOS?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>When <a href=#>5 Seconds of Summer</a> popped onto the music scene, many immediately began comparing the boy band to <a href=#>One Direction</a>. It didn't help that one of their biggest breaks was opening for One Direction on their "Take Me Home" tour.</p><p>But this group of four Australian men have slowly distanced themselves from the expectations that came with being an Australian 1D. Over the years, their sound has been distinctly different than the upbeat pop tunes of their British counterparts, vibing with more punk energy.</p><p>Even so, the fear that 5SOS will meet the same demise as 1D did is fresh in fans' minds, especially as Ashton Irwin announces his first solo album. After releasing "Skinny Skinny," the first single from his upcoming album "Superbloom," fans began to worry this was the beginning of the end for the beloved boy band.</p><p>So do fans have any reason to be worried about 5SOS <a href=#>breaking up</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 5SOS breaking up?</h2><p>One Direction fans will remember that once Zayn Malik began releasing his own music separate from his boy band mates, it didn't take long for the internationally-loved band to call it quits.</p><p>Ashton releasing his own music holds a similar feeling for many 5SOS fans. The band has been active since 2011, giving them almost a decade of experience together. It's natural that the members would want to use this leverage to launch their solo careers, but what does that mean for their band?</p><p>Before you get yourself worked up over their potential demise, there's actually nothing to suggest that "Skinny Skinny" is signaling the beginning of the end for 5SOS. Long term fans will remember that after putting out their album "Sounds Good Feels Good" in 2015, the group took a three-year hiatus to take some time apart and recalibrate themselves.</p><p>That break resulted in "Youngblood," their 2018 album that emerged with a sound so different than the one the group had initially established.</p><p>That break was arguably the peak opportunity for the boys to break up, but instead it resulted in music that some would argue was better than their previous work, continuing to skyrocket them to popularity.</p><p>The group even previously announced they had a tour scheduled for 2020 (though with the COVID-19 pandemic, it's been postponed). The band members currently seem very attached to their work in the group, and it's unlikely they're planning on ending 5SOS anytime soon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It is with a great explosion of joy and with my entire soul that I am proudly announcing to you all that I am releasing my first solo record. The album explores my inner philosophies and feelings about the walk of life I have found myself on. I’m ridiculously excited to share this with you, it feels like this record has been over a decade in the making. It brings me the greatest joy of all that I am in a band that allows me to create freely inside and outside of it. I can’t wait for you to hear it. You can pre-order my debut solo album ‘Superbloom’ out October 23rd everywhere tonight. Pre-save now from the link in my profile. The first single “Skinny Skinny” is out everywhere tonight at 9pm PT. We must fight against a common darkness that shadows our ability to live truthfully, to live without self doubt, and without self destruction and love ourselves for what we are. When writing “Skinny Skinny” I first thought of myself, and many other young peoples struggles with body image and particularly body dysmorphia. It’s something I’ve never confronted in a creative form and I am feeling strong in saying “Skinny Skinny” goes directly to that painful place in my mind.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ashton Irwin</a> (@ashtonirwin) on Sep 23, 2020 at 12:00pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Ashton Irwin leaving 5SOS?</h2><p>Just like 1D's breakup was initiated by Zayn announcing his departure from the group, many are worried that Ashton will be the first of 5SOS to leave the band.</p><p>At this time, Ashton has made no public comment that would indicate he's planning to leave the group. In fact, he's publicly stated that he's proud the band gives him that flexibility to create outside of the music they make together.</p><p>"It brings me the greatest joy of all that I am in a band that allows me to create freely inside and outside of it," he wrote in an Instagram post announcing his new single. "I can’t wait for you to hear it."</p><p>While it's easy to worry what Ashton's new foray could mean for the group, it's better to enjoy it for what it is and bop along to "Skinny Skinny" — right after you listen through all of "Calm" again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBugdKoqmaaopqurLXNoGSuqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./geostorm-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Geostorm - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mo-vlogs-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mo Vlogs - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
