The enthusiasm for that special day we felt as a child could be carried on over into adulthood, and then there are those who would rather not make a big fuss about the whole thing.</p><p>And there are those who would argue that maybe love for birthdays is rooted in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">particular gender bias</a>.</p><p>While the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">psychology of birthdays can be discussed at length</a>, there doesn't seem to be a study on the mental gymnastics of the ethics of fajita ordering at people's birthday dinners.</p><p>Thankfully, this TikToker, in a viral clip, has got us all covered. In short: Don't do it. And she explains why, but is she serious?</p><p>"DO NOT ORDER FAJITAS AT MY BIRTHDAY DINNER," Asha (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashadaviid</a>) warns at the top of her video, sending out a warning to anyone and everyone who plans on attending one of her birthday parties that if there are fajitas on the menu, you better not even think about telling your sever you want them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ashadaviid href=#>@ashadaviid</a><p>Like this is Bday etiquette 101 <a title=fypage href=#>#fypage</a> <a title=birthdatdinner href=#>#birthdatdinner</a> <a title=easye href=#>#EasyE</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Asha" href=#>♬ original sound - Asha</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @ashadaviid</span></figure><p>She explains her reasoning in her clip as she speaks directly into the camera: "I seen a TikTok yesterday on here and it was basically like this guy, it was his birthday dinner and his friend beside him ordered fajitas," she states.</p><p>"And I thought it was so funny because my biggest pet peeve is people ordering fajitas at birthday dinners. I think it's the most disrespectful thing that you could possibly do at somebody's birthday dinner. I'd rather somebody show up late than order fajitas at my birthday dinner, and here's why."</p><p>With her sunglasses and hat on while still indoors, she delineates why she finds the practice to be so off-putting. "Nine times out of 10, when you order fajitas, 'cause I myself am a fajita orderer, not on anybody's birthday, or a special occasion, but I do order them in my spare time, and nine times out of 10, they're gonna bring those fajitas out before anybody else's food," she explains.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ashadaviid</span></figure><p>She then states that she isn't a fan of the fact that fajitas are celebrated upon being brought out to the table:</p><p>"Why? I don't know but if you noticed, fajitas get brought out before everybody else's food. OK, not only do they get brought out, they kind of get their own little celebratory like, you know, bringing out, you know what I mean, like? It's, it's baffling honestly."</p><p>Asha calls out the hullabaloo that is often associated with fajita ordering: "They're already sizzling so that's already enough but now like, you know you got little wooden board up under your plate and s--t, like you know they just do the most for fajita orders and I think also the waiter always coddles the person who orders fajitas."</p><p>At this point in the clip it's pretty evident she isn't happy with all of the special attention that fajita orderers receive at restaurants: "Like they're going out with a bang or something, like I do not like that. They're always like, 'Oh sweetie the plate's hot like, let me move this for you.' Like girl, not too much."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ashadaviid</span></figure><p>It certainly seems like she's upset other people are going to get attention drawn to them at her birthday dinner. "It's a fajita, like, that's my thing you're doing too much on my big day," Asha says.</p><p>By the end of the clip, it appears that Asha's main gripe with sizzling restaurant fajitas is that she's jealous of them and is worried that her personality isn't beloved, pleasant, or strong enough to contend with some grilled meats, vegetables, and a set of tortillas.</p><p>Numerous TikTokers responded to her video. One commenter joked, "If them fajitas out shining you then it was never your day."</p><p>This was a sentiment echoed by someone else who remarked: "If fajitas are outshining you, you were never that girl. sorry not sorry."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ashadaviid</span></figure><p>There were just so many people who couldn't understand why someone would be so concerned with the fact that a grown adult was worried about what other people were ordering at her birthday party: "Girl, fajitas upstaging you on your birthday … chileeeee 😂😂😂😂😂," someone else said.</p><p>However, judging by some of the comments left by other users, and Asha's response to them, it would seem that she may have just been trolling everyone on TikTok with a deadpan delivery. "I’m sooo glad my friends are cool! Cause honey if my friend call me the next day upset cause I ordered fajitas I’m going to lafffff so hard!!!" one person said.</p><p>To which Asha responded: "You should be ashamed of yourself 😂😂😂😂."</p><p>Another wrote: "I can’t tell if you being fr or not 😭😭😭," and all Asha did was reply with more emoji laughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyvwIyoqZ2domKzorbIrZisZZGpeqO10a2fnZmpYrGqus2eqaw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./66518-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Is Squeezing The Life Out Of PDP Kwankwaso</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andre-onana-completes-e51-million-move-to-manchester-united.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andre Onana Completes 51 Million Move To Manchester United</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
