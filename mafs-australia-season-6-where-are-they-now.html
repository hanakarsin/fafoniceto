Did they stick together? Did the broken-hearted find true love, or are they committed to workin on themselves? Here's a breakdown of what all of the <a href=#>MAFS contestants are up to these days</a> (and yes, who they're dating).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ning Surasiang and Mark Scrivens</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Unfortunately, Ning and Mark did not end up together. Mark called off the whole thing during the final ceremony, which deeply upset Ning (understandably). This happened back in 2018, and it looks like now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ning has a new a new boyfriend</a> named Kane Micallef, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark has been with new(ish) girlfriend</a>, Bianca Chatfield.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ines Basic and Bronson Norrish</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Ines and Bronson broke up after only a few weeks. Bronson is now dating someone named Hayley Wallis. In April 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote on Instagram</a>, "You’re not searching for someone to complete you, you are searching for someone to share your iso [sic] life with. I met this amazing lady through&nbsp;@cherriidate&nbsp;and can’t believe it."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Susie Bradley and Billy Vincent</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Fans felt for Billy after Susie made him cry. The couple split shortly after that. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy seems to be dating pro snowboarder Rani Siregar </a>(who developed some feels toward Billy when watching this season of MAFS), and Susie is in a relationship with rugby star Todd Carney. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two welcomed a baby boy</a> in March 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sam Ball and Elizabeth Sobinoff</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Sam and Elizabeth decided they weren't right for each other after Sam caught himself having feelings for Ines Basic. These days, you may not even recognize Sam, as he cut off all his hair. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He currently lives in Canberra</a>, joined the army, and graduated from the Kapooka Army Recruit Training program. Sam seems to be single at the moment. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As for Lizzie</a>, she went back on MAFS, where she was paired with Seb Guilhaus. Unfortunately, that relationship didn't work out either.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lauren Huntriss and Matthew Bennett</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Lauren and Matt broke up when Matt realized he wasn't attracted to Lauren. Matthew has a new girlfriend Annabelle who he met at his wrestling club (now that's some meet cute), and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he gushes about her</a> all the time. Lauren seems to be single, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on her Instagram account</a>, but it's possible she's just keeping things private.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mike Gunner and Heidi Latcham</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Mike and Heidi announced that they were breaking at the post-finale reunion special, and apparently haven't talked to each other since then. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike has a new girlfriend</a>, Sonja Marcelline, who he met on Bumble. Heidi appears to be single, but looks totally different (that bleach blonde 'do!). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You can follow her on Instagram</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dan Webb and Tamara Joy</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>These two haven't had the smoothest sailing relationship, since Dan hooked up with Jessica and Tamara hooked up with Jessica's ex, Mick. Dan and Jessica dated for a while, but then broke up in 2019. The latest update with Dan, is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's been charged with alleged fraud</a>. Tamara has gone through quite a transformation, and has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a few pictures</a> with some hunky dudes who she says are "#friends."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessika Power and Dan Webb</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>So, like we said, Jessika and Dan eventually broke up. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessika is currently dating an aspiring rapper</a> named Filip. He goes by "Filthy Fil" when he's on stage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessika Power and Mick Gould</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Again, Jessika and Mick didn't work out either. After the show wrapped up, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick retreated back to his farm</a>, where he lives a pretty low-key life. Although he is apparently dating Kayla Gray from The Bachelor and have been living together in Queensland.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Martha Kalifatidis and Michael Brunelli</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>These two seemed to be together as of May, but on May 10, 2021, it was reported that Martha and Michael are no longer a couple. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The breakup was allegedly over</a> Michael shaving his beard (he didn't actually do this). There were also rumors that Martha was found spending time with an ex. Also, it's important to note that we don't know whether or not these two will get back together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cam Merchant and Jules Robinson</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jules (@julesrobinson82)</a></p></figure><p>This beautiful couple! They're currently still together and going quite strong. In fact, they had their first child together, Oliver Chase Merchant on October 3, 2020. Just three days ago, they took an adorable photo of the two of them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Melissa Lucarelli and Dino Hira</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Melissa and Dino were the third couple to end up exiting the show because they never found the spark needed to keep them together. It seems like both are single at the moment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cyrell Jimenez and Nic Jovanovic</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>This pair called it quit, and now Cyrell has a baby with a Love Island runner-up, Even Dally! Nic, who battled cancer, works with charities such as The Cancer Council and Movember Foundation to raise awareness about the disease. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He states that</a> his “health is great now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6nv4yarKysopa5qq2MrJyaq5%2Bjend51qGcq51dlr%2BmedOhnLJlnqTE</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./372381-man-united-lask-lingard-martial-score-man-united-reach-europa-league-quarters-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Man United vs LASK: Lingard, Martial score as Man United reach Europa League quarters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./two-months-after-proposal-solomon-buchi-part-ways-with-fiancee-nigerians-react.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Two Months After Proposal Solomon Buchi Part Ways With Fiance, Nigerians React</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
