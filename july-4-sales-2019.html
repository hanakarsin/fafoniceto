Whether you shop in small boutiques, big box stores, or online, there are a ton of deals to be had this holiday weekend. To help maximize your savings, here are all the best 4th of July sales going on this weekend — some of which are already underway if you want to get a head start.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Macy's</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macy's</a> 4th of July sale is already underway both in stores and online and continues until July 7. Shoppers online can enjoy up to 20 percent off sale prices with the promo code FOURTH at checkout. And that can mean savings as high as 65 percent off retail on fashion and housewares. If you're a procrastinator, it's also a great time to shop swimwear, as selections throughout the department store are discounted 35-50 percent.</p><p>Perhaps one of the biggest deals they have on right now is for KitchenAid stand mixers. Normally retailing at over $300, aspiring bakers can pick up a 4.5 Qt. Classic Plus model for less than $200.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Target</h2><p>If you're keen on decorating your home and outdoor spaces this summer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Target</a> has patio and furniture items marked down 30 percent through Thursday for online purchases with the promo code AMERICA. In addition, savings of 20 percent off or more are available on summer essentials like swimwear (promo code SWIM), sandals, outdoor grills, and pool accessories.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Walmart</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart</a> has discounts and rollbacks on top of their Everyday Low Prices in virtually every department, from groceries to camping supplies.

Until July 10, shoppers receive up to 40 percent savings on select appliance packages. You can also earn up to $500 in gift cards with the purchase of two or more appliances totaling $999 or more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Home Depot</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a> also has some attractive savings on appliances now until July 10.

Up to 70 percent off in stores and online on handbags, shoes, and apparel.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. Old Navy</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Navy</a> is encouraging you to shop purple with them, because purple is what you get when red, white, and blue come together. "We're celebrating the purple 4th of July — one nation, indivisible, with liberty and fun for all." But even if purple isn't your color, you can still get 60 percent off throughout the store in person and online until July 7.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Pier 1</h2><p>Want to make a big bang? Now through July 7, you can get an extra 25 percent off regular, sale, and clearance prices with the promo code FIREWORKS. That's on furniture, bedding, dinnerware, room accessories, you name it, though exclusions may apply for certain items.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. IKEA</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Save up to half off on a lot of in-store items until July 7, but if you don't have an IKEA near you or prefer to shop online, you're not left out by the Swedish home goods store. All duvet sets are 20 percent off, and select cushions and table lamps are 50 percent off for members of IKEA's loyalty program.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. JC Penney</h2><p>Remember when JC Penney was like "we're done with sales, we'll just always have low prices." Ugh, thank god that's over. We love a sale, what can we say. With the code HOLIDAY3, take $10 off a $25 order in-store or take 25 percent off online purchases of at least $100 until July 7. Plus they have discounts up to 50 percent on bed and bath, 60 percent on furnitures and mattresses, and 70 percent on outdoor furniture and accessories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8KtxYxtZKyZnJrAbn6PanA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adriana-de-moura-kids-rhom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Adriana De Mouras Son, Alex Sidi, and Why He Hasnt Been on RHOM?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-beautiful-young-couple-found-dead-in-toilet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beautiful Young Couple Found Dead In Toilet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
