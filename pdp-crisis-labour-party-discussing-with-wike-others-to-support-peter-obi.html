It is now incumbent on us to let those who don’t have the influence of the social media, who are influenced by money, learn that the little money they get that will not last for two weeks is not enough to sacrifice the whole of the next four years; that if they are in a position to resist the money, they should resist it, but, if they can’t resist it, they should take the money and vote wisely.</p><p>“Now, let me say this. We are open to discussing with other parties. Naturally, we will like to see the Labour Party in the entirety of the Senate, House of Reps and state assemblies. That should be our first option.”</p><h2>Wike Has More Governors Than Atiku On His Side</h2><p>A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>claimed that</a></strong> the camp of Rivers State Governor, <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> has the support of more governors in the party than the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar</p><p>The PDP leader who spoke on condition of anonymity with The Nation revealed this while reacting to the claim that Atiku had more governors on his side.</p><p>There had been claimed that the former vice president has the support of six governors, while Wike has the support of five governors.</p><p>The source in the camp of Governor Wike in his reaction said Atiku’s camp does not have up to six governors on his side.</p><p>According to the source, a drama will unfold soon that will make it visible that Atiku does not have that much support.</p><p>He further stated that Governor Wike’s camp has rejected the shifting of the office of BoT chairman in the party to the South.</p><p>The source added that the camp may reject campaign directorate offers from Atiku unless the national chairman of the party Ayu is removed.</p><p>The party chieftain said Wike’s camp may not contribute to the campaign, adding that it may engage in minimum participation at all levels.</p><p>He said the camp will protect the interest of the party to retain power in their various states.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BpZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmpJGXvLa%2BjKmYq6ypYrGqv8Kuqqyhnpx6uLXToWSwoZuaerDAx56prGWkpHq0wc%2BppqusXaWytbHRZqaboV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./preppyclaws-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>preppyclaws - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-taylor-1995-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Russell Taylor - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
