The archaeological excavations revealed great works of art in iron, copper, bronze, and other materials that belong to the ancient Kingdom of Nri. These works have featured a high level of development of the administrative system of the Kingdom of Nri which was located on Anambra River from 948 to 1911.</p><p class=align-left>In some areas like Ogidi, local families held hereditary royal titles for centuries. Being under the rule of Great Britain, Nri kings were recognized as legal rulers. In the 19th century, these noble leaders have been appointed as Warrant Chiefs collecting taxes and fulfilling other duties.</p><p class=align-left>The history of Anambra State drastically changed when the Nigerian Civil War began on July 6, 1967. It was a war between Nigeria and Biafra commonly known as the Biafran War. It was a civil war between the government of Nigeria and the separatist state of Biafra. The war was caused by a 1966 military coup.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53c283d70d597e4a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>We don’t want Biafra, southeast governor declares, speaks the mind of Igbo people</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During this war, Biafran engineers constructed a relief airstrip named “Annabelle”. It was used to supply food and medicine for the Biafran population. On this airstrip, American pilots like Alex Nicoll sacrificed their lives in the service of humanity delivering relief supplies to the Biafran people who were starving as well as continuously harassed by the Nigerian aircraft. The aircraft used in the war were called “Babies of Biafra” in honour of the babies who died from starvation in Biafra.</p><p class=align-left>The Biafran war ended on January 15, 1970. Today, the Igbo people succeed in every area of social life including education, industry, trade, amenities, commerce, infrastructures, and even agriculture. The story of success of Igbo nation showed that they are hardworking, and determined to overcome difficulties in whatever situation they are.</p><p class=align-left>During the recent years, Anambra State has experienced a lot of political turmoils, but the efforts of the present day administration are aimed at the fast resurrection and creating a suitable environment for development.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/86e589ac2166d7fe.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>4 reasons why Ondo is blessed by God more than all other states in Nigeria</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cb943e30706b74a.png><p class=align-left>Photo: culturesofwestafrica.com</p><h3>When was Anambra state created?</h3><p class=align-left>The history of Anambra State can be divided into two parts. In 1976, Old Anambra State was created from the part of East Central State. The capital was Enugu.</p><p class=align-left>On August 27, 1991, it underwent re-organisation being divided into 2 states, Anambra and Enugu. A further reorganization of the Nigerian federation in 1991 led to creating Anambra State out of the Old Anambra state.</p><p class=align-left>The current capital of Anambra is Awka, the Home of Igbo Blacksmiths, with 21 local government areas. According to the 2006 census, the population of Anambra State is 4,177,828 people. Land area is 4,844 km2. It consists of 177 autonomous communities.

The same year, Chinwoke Mbadinuju became the first Democratic governor of Anambra state after many years of military rule. He faced many serious problems, for example, withholding of teachers' salaries in the schools. A 10-month strike was conducted in all secondary schools, however, it didn't bring any visible changes. The governor imposed a tuition fee of N3,000 for the secondary school which caused a massive demonstration by students in Anambra state. It was Chinwoke Mbadinuju's failure which was solved later by his successors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7cd49498f7d6d0d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 richest towns in Anambra state: Interesting facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since the 1990s, there was observed the first wave of migration from rural to urban areas in Anambra state which made Anambra a state with 63% of the population living in the cities. For the reason of neglecting infrastructure and inappropriate governance, there occurred a lot of problems in the state. The improvement of infrastructure couldn't keep up with the growth in population.</p><p class=align-left>Although, the present day government is doing huge steps towards the overall wealth and sustainability, there are still problems in the provision of social services, environmental sanitation, erosion control, and so on. Many towns still have deteriorated roads, poor building system, poor sanitation, illegal street trading, tons of unrecycled garbage, unregulated transport system, high level of congestion, overcrowding, and other.</p><p class=align-left>In 2009, Peter Obi, the former governor of Anambra State, designed a 20-year plan of restoring urban planning for 3 major cities in the Anambra state (Onitsha, Nnewi, and Awka). The plan contained ideas on the beautification of the cities, land use, industrial development, waste disposal, road infrastructure, water supply, housing and health, and educational facilities.
