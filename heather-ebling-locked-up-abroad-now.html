On the way back, however, she encountered unusual complications before being told by a security officer that large quantities of cocaine were found in her luggage. As "Colombian Double Cross," a new episode of Locked Up Abroad reveals, it's uncertain whether she was aware that her suitcase contained Class A drugs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Single mom Heather recounts her stay in a Colombian holding cell after her dream vacation took a dark turn. <a href=#>#LockedUpAbroad</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kqWE4ICbvM</a></p>— Locked Up Abroad (@LockedUpAbroad) <a href=#>February 18, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>According to an episode trailer, Ebling began to experience unexpected health complications shortly after she and a friend arrived at the El Dorado Airport. She went to the restroom just when they reached the security line, and upon her return, was guided away by a member of security.&nbsp;</p><p>"I did get a visit from the Embassy while I was there in those holding cells. In those initial moments, I believed that I was going home," Ebling explained in a teaser. However, her expectations turned out to be false.&nbsp;</p><p>She was detained on the scene. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, Ebling didn't know about the drugs in her bag. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Single mom Heather Ebling’s vacation to Colombia doesn’t live up to her expectations.

However, the judge warned that she would be sentenced to eight years if the information she shared was found misleading. She pleaded guilty. According to the outlet, she ended up in a prison cell with Marla David, a 25-year-old from Lancaster, Pa., who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for drug trafficking.&nbsp;</p><p>Ebling, David, and another U.S. citizen named Vivian Carrasquillo became known as 'Las Gringas' at the prison facility.
