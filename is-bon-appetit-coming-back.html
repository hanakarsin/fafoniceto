Dawn is a vice president at Simon & Schuster where she heads 37 Ink, an imprint dedicated to sharing stories from marginalized communities. She also started a book club celebrating Black authors called the Inkwell Book Club.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Dawn Davis, the new editor-in-chief?</h2><p>Dawn told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> that she aims “to tap into my particular asset, which is a Rolodex over 25 years of working with writers, some from marginalized communities, and elevating those voices and those experiences.”&nbsp;</p><p>Dawn didn’t say whether she would be inviting BA’s former stars back to the negotiating table or if she was looking for entirely fresh talent.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span><p>Dawn Davis</p></figure><p>Dawn is also joined by Eater’s Sonia Chopra, who will serve as BA’s new executive editor. Hopefully these two women will be able to turn the website around and make changes for the better. We’ll just have to wait and see.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened at 'Bon Appétit' this summer?</h2><p>The controversy at Bon Appétit started back in June when a photo of then-editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport in brown-face surfaced online and proceeded to get the usual, expected backlash. However, the photo also kicked off a conversation about diversity on the BA platform and highlighted the fact that several of the BIPOC contributors to the channel weren’t being compensated as much as their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>Staff including Priya Krishna and Sohla El-Waylly revealed a less-than-carefree work environment that was at odds with the cheery facade the organization puts forth in their videos. Sohla was one of the first to call out the organization, pointing out her low salary compared to her white counterparts, and said that she had been pushed in front of the camera as a display of diversity.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the fact that sohla was hired at bon appetit for $50K/year and doesn’t get paid for video appearances like her white colleagues is digusting. anyways here’s a montage of her cooking circles around everyone at ba <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uzZsRMGIwf</a></p>— sarah (@s_whip_) <a href=#>June 11, 2020</a></figure><p>Adam quickly stepped down from his role but soon after, a deluge of other complaints came forward from a number of non-white employees and contributors at Bon Appétit. "There is a big difference in terms of how they monetarily value the white employees versus the people of color,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sohla</a> said in an Instagram Story that went viral.&nbsp;</p><p>The website subsequently published a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy apology</a>, saying that things were "going to change” from then on. They promised that they were "prioritizing people of color for the editor in chief candidate pool, implementing anti-racism training for staff, and resolving any pay inequities that are found across all departments ... This is just the start,” the post concluded. “We want to be transparent, accountable, and active as we begin to dismantle racism at our brands.”</p><p>However, in August, a number of contributors at Bon Appétit began to announce their departure from the website after negotiations for more equitable pay and air-time seemed to be going nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Priya Krishna said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter post</a> that “I am constantly being told that I am an important part of the test kitchen, yet leadership refuses to acknowledge that in the form of compensation or opportunities.” She was accompanied by other popular on-air talents.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurs6nZJqooJrBqsCMnKamoZ6ceqOtwqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1415062-policeman-killed-brutal-attack-as-security-operatives-clash-with-shiites-abuja-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Policeman Killed in Brutal Attack As Security Operatives Clash With Shiites in Abuja</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dbanj-files-petition-against-do2dtun-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dbanj Files Petition Against Do2dtun (Details)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
