They know he can say things about them.”</p><p>Another source revealed that the PDP presidential candidate&nbsp;has activated a process to reach out to aggrieved leaders of the party.</p><p>The source said: “There are some internal processes that have been activated to ensure that those people (Wike’s allies) are properly aligned with the dictates of the party which is to ensure that the party wins in 2023, which in fairness to those people, they are not averse to except for Wike. We don’t even know what he’s up to and those who say they are with him (Wike) don’t know what he is up to.”</p><p>An ally of Atiku stated that the presidential candidate of the PDP and other party leaders would not do anything that is unconstitutional in a bid to remove the embattled Ayu.</p><p>“Atiku and leaders of the PDP will never do anything unconstitutional because of Wike because Nigerians are watching. He will keep pushing and even after getting what he wants, he will ask for something else. We know his game,” he told Vanguard.</p><p>“There must be a stop to this and that is why we want to move on with his people.</p><p>“Those insisting that Ayu must resign are overlooking the constitution which states that his replacement must come from the North. They say it doesn’t matter. But the ripple effect would be too damning because you cannot then insist that the replacement from the North should resign, and then it will affect the national secretary, and down the line.”</p><p>Another source said that some of those with Wike was already looking at how they can avoid “becoming collateral victims of somebody else’s war.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FvZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmr5ViuK%2B71mafoqtdnK6usYyaq6KjpWKurbjInqpmpZ%2Brsm7AzmaZq52RoHq4tcqeqmafoqTCsXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./buharis-adc-cso-garba-shehu-lai-mohd-others-contract-covid-19.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buhari's ADC, CSO, Garba Shehu, Lai Moh'd, Others Contract COVID-19</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mina-starsiak-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Mina Starsiak's Kids?
