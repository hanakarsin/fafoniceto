Though his eventual appearance has been hinted at by various characters for quite some time, Ayato had yet to appear in the game. But along with some epic news for Version 2.5, Mihoyo has finally officially unveiled Ayato as a future playable character. When will he finally be released?</p><p>In the sprawling world of Genshin Impact, the Traveler's search for their lost sibling takes them to the Japanese-inspired nation of Inazuma. There, they encounter an Archon named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raiden Shogun</a> who strives to keep her nation isolated from the rest of the world. After resolving the conflict, Inazuma and its people are free to visit other nations once more.</p><p>Inazuma introduced many new popular playable characters to the game, but Ayato has been a long time coming.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Genshin Impact/Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When will Ayato be released in 'Genshin Impact'?</h2><p>Though character details on Ayato have been elusive since the game's release, his existence is no secret. As the brother of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayaka</a>, a playable Cryo character who was released in July 2021, he is mentioned by her explicitly in one of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in-game voice lines</a>. According to Ayaka, Ayato is the head of the Kamisato clan who typically has an incredibly busy schedule, which would certainly explain his absence up until this point.</p><p>While his presence was briefly hinted at in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previous trailer</a>, Ayato's design was officially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> in early February 2022 to coincide with a news update on the upcoming update for the game. His official character description reads: "As the head of the Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Ayato is committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of the region."</p><p>Ayato is also confirmed to be a Hydro character who utilizes water attacks in combat, which may work well with his sister's icy swordplay.</p><p>But when will Ayato finally be playable? If Genshin's release schedule is any indication, he at least won't be in 2.5. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently announced banners</a> don't include Ayato just yet. But in the past, characters who are revealed alongside big info dumps for new versions typically get released in the version after the upcoming one.</p><p>Leakers seem to corroborate tis theory. According to a December 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a>, Ayato is rumored to arrive in Version 2.6, a month or so after 2.5 drops. The leak also describes his appearance accurately, despite his design having only been revealed later on. While fans should take this with a grain of salt, we could easily Ayato being released some time in March.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mihoyo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is the 'Genshin Impact' Version 2.5 release date?</h2><p>Though Ayato fans will have to wait a little longer to play as him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Version 2.5</a> is just around the corner!
