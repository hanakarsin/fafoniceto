The newest game's predecessor, MLB the Show 21, was the first to include Xbox consoles in its lineup, but MLB the Show 22 takes that even further. This is the first game in the franchise to also become available on the Nintendo Switch, expanding the game's audience even further.</p><p>There will also be new difficulty modes, so players of all expertise can give it a try seamlessly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, though, despite the demand for the game to come to PC, this new title will not be available at launch for PC, nor have there been any plans announced to bring it to PC.</p><p>MLB the Show 22 also comes with full cross-play and cross-progression compatibility, meaning so long as you've connected your game to an MLB account, you can play with anyone on any console and pick up your game across platforms, so long as you have an internet connection.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'MLB the Show 22' also features new gameplay mechanics and new commentators.</h2><p>Of course, a new platform to play on isn't the only new feature the developers have brought to the franchise. With this new installment, players now have three different types of swings they can choose from in the batter's box. You can make a normal, contact, or power swing, though you should also note that there are bigger penalties for whiffs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>There are also different modes to play to add even more variety than previous games. You can make more than one character to play, so you have a choice when going into different play modes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Players can also track their progress in a battle royale-style progression, giving different daily challenges and bosses to beat to earn more points.</p><p>As mentioned before, there will also be online co-op options, allowing players to create teams of two or three to play against others instead of AI opponents.</p><p>In addition to all of these features, there's also a new broadcast team. For MLB the Show 22, Jon "Boog" Sciambi and Chris Singleton will be featured as commentators.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation's blog</a>, the two sports commentators recorded over 45,000 lines of audio for the game, and since the two commentators did many of their recording sessions together, hopefully, the title's new conversation system will result in natural banter throughout gameplay.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhformjedOhnGarmKTEbn6RZqWer12bsqLA1KucrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./when-does-the-rookie-come-on.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Rookie Has a New Air Time Heres What You Need to Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./june1-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>June 1 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
