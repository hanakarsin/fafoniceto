Aside from acting, The Lovely Bones star has had a lifelong love affair with food, which he considers to be a principal theme in his life.</p><p>Stanley Tucci's 2021 memoir and cookbook, Taste: My Life Through Food, explores his relationship with various cuisines, his admiration for his foodie mother, and the devastating <a href=#>cancer diagnosis</a> that shook his world three years ago. Said diagnosis affected his approach to eating in a way that left him hungry in every sense of the word. As for the kind of cancer he had, it's relatively rare.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What kind of cancer was Stanley Tucci diagnosed with?</h2><p>Three years ago, Stanley was on the receiving end of a gut-wrenching oral cancer diagnosis. "It was devastating. Luckily, the cure rate was very high," he told Good Morning America. Doctors told Stanley, whose wife died of breast cancer in 2009, the tumor on his tongue was "too large" to operate on directly, leaving him with "high-dose radiation and chemotherapy" as the best options to proceed with.</p><p>"So it's three years later now and everything is fine, but I was unable to eat solid food for six months," he explained. Though "everything is fine" now, the effects of the radiation and chemotherapy were difficult to endure, as he had no appetite and couldn't taste or swallow for a long period of time, even requiring a feeding tube. "My taste buds and saliva glands were destroyed, as was the inside of my mouth, and it's taken really two years to get back to almost normal."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stanley Tucci (@stanleytucci)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @stanleytucci</a></figure><p>In a graphic description of his experience, Stanley stated, "Anything I ate tasted like wet cardboard slathered with someone's excrement." That sounds both repulsive and depressing. "I mean, if you can’t eat and enjoy food, how are you going to enjoy everything else?" Us foodies, who find joy in both creating and eating beautifully prepared dishes, couldn't agree more.</p><p>Despite not yet feeling 100 percent like himself in 2019, Stanley decided to push himself and film CNN's travel show Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy. Though his sense of taste returned by the time filming began, swallowing food was another story. "I had to chew it for 10 minutes to get it down my throat," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Times</a> of his experience eating Florentine Steak.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stanley Tucci (@stanleytucci)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @stanleytucci</a></figure><p>Despite the struggles, both emotional and physical ones, Stanley was dedicated to filming the travel show, a passion project focussing on Italy's wide range of mouthwatering cuisines. "I've wanted to tell for a long time the story of Italy and the disparate cuisine in every region." Stanley didn't let the effects of his sickness consume his life, but he did accept them. "I feel much older than I did before I was sick. But you still want to get ahead and get things done.”</p><p>Taste: My Life Through Food releases on Oct. 5, 2021, and Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy is streaming on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIykoKecXaSzbq%2FAp5qeql2ZtqV50q2Yp6SVrnq1wcKcoGagkauy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amyah-bennett-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amyah Bennett - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./operation-safe-corridor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Operation Safe Corridor On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
