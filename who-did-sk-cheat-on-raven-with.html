Of course, the world already knows most of how the couples and singles are doing after the season, thanks to the Love Is Blind Season 3 reunion.</p><p>However, the After the Altar special served up some extra tea about the couples, including details regarding <a href=#>Raven Ross</a> discovering that <a href=#>Sikuru “SK” Alagbada</a> cheated on her, leading to <a href=#>their breakup</a>. Of course, folks who have been keeping up with the drama online are aware that multiple women stepped forward claiming to have had a relationship with SK.</p><p>Truth be told, clout is a hell of a drug. Some people will do anything for 15 seconds of fame, even if that means hurting someone. So, it’s always best to take cheating rumors with a grain of salt.</p><p>However, some of the women’s claims proved to be quite substantial as receipts made their way online.</p><p>So, who did SK cheat on Raven with?

Hannah started by sharing that she and SK were friends-turned-lovers who hung out a lot and attended various events from weddings to birthday celebrations with each other.</p><p>However, she said that they broke up and remained good friends.</p><p>As the video continued, Hannah shared various photos of herself with SK attending multiple events.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@socialmedia_tv_comentary href=#>@socialmedia_tv_comentary</a><p>SK cheats on Raven with @hannahbethstyle <a title=loveisblindseason3 href=#>#loveisblindseason3</a> <a title=loveisblind href=#>#loveisblind</a> <a title=sk href=#>#sk</a> <a title=raven href=#>#raven</a> <a title=lib href=#>#lib</a> <a title=lib3 href=#>#lib3</a> <a title=netflix href=#>#netflix</a> <a title=marriedcouple href=#>#marriedcouple</a> <a title=marriage href=#>#marriage</a> <a title=realitytv href=#>#realitytv</a> <a title=wtf href=#>#wtf</a> <a title=loveisblindnetflix href=#>#loveisblindnetflix</a> <a title=loveisblindreunion href=#>#loveisblindreunion</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - social&realityTV investigation" href=#>♬ original sound - social&realityTV investigation</a></figure><p>Then, Hannah says that SK invited her to go to Ibiza in late July 2021 — and provided text messages and location stamps as proof — which is when things started to get murky.</p><p>However, once she asked Sk to see his phone to send herself pictures, she noticed messages from a person with their name listed as “fiance.”</p><p>Hannah then shared that she confronted SK about the messages and his fiancée at dinner. SK allegedly told her that it was for “LIB and that he was just friends with [Raven] and that they were doing it for money.”</p><p>Although Hannah didn’t fully believe him, she let it go.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@socialmedia_tv_commentary</a></figure><p>However, Hannah claims she was still uneasy about it so she confronted SK again.

In May 2022, she invited SK on a Cabo trip. She says that he paid for their tickets.</p><p>SK also went to visit Hannah in August of that year, per Hannah’s text message receipts.
