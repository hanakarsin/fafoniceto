So, it is premature and pre-emptive for me at this moment, now to arrive at any conclusion, taking into consideration that I have not gone through the document to understand what it contains and then analyse the same in accordance with the constitution and the prevailing laws.”</p><p>The Minister when asked if he loved democracy and wanted the advancement said, “I am working for the advancement of democracy and the democratic system.”</p><p>Responding to a question on if he was willing to assist Buhari to pass what the President said he wanted to leave behind as a legacy of good elections for Nigeria; and if the bill might get passed by Buhari, the minister said, “Honestly, without going through or reading through, I am not in a position to assess whether the bill, indeed, has factored the national and public interest, as against selfish interest, among others; whether it is a bill that can stand the test of constitutionality and legality.”</p><p>Malami when asked if he would advise the President to reject the amended bill if he was not satisfied with the new version, said, “Certainly, if I am not satisfied and if I am of the opinion that it is against the public interest, the national interest; and then against the dictates of the democratic process, I would advise accordingly.”</p><p>He added, “But then, one thing I can tell you is that we are all interested in leaving behind a legacy of a lasting democracy; a democracy that indeed accommodates the collective interest of the Nigerian state, and eventually advances the national interest, national development and deepens the democratic process.</p><p>“So, with these considerations associated with deepening democracy; with the considerations associated with the national and public interest, we will certainly do whatever it takes to move democracy to the next level.”</p><p>When asked to express to Nigerians, his commitment to deepening democracy in Nigeria, the minister stated that his office is a constitutional one, which is fundamentally governed by public interest. “And when we are talking of the public interest, I am talking of the interest of 200 million Nigerians. I will be guided at all times by my oath of office associated with the public interest, exclusive of the sentiments or the feelings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49xZqaZnJa6qnnRnq2emZyoeri02GaZrqCRp7ZuucCyZKenpGLAqrPNZpylnZOpvLOty2aZoqScZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ward-cameron-really-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Few 'Outer Banks' Characters Come Close to Death's Door but Does [SPOILER] Really Die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-dont-know-fgs-exact-position-on-fuel-subsidy-removal-lai-mohammed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Don't Know FGs Exact Position On Fuel Subsidy Removal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
