Ricki lost her husband, Christian Evans, in 2017. The jewelry designer completed suicide after a long battle with bipolar disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>Christian's mental illness made the marriage a rocky one, resulting in a 2014 separation. Though they later reconciled, ultimately Ricki finalized the divorce, but that didn't mean she had stopped loving the man she called her "soulmate."</p><p>At the time of his passing, she wrote on Instagram, "He was a man of love and what mends my broken heart today is knowing that he is finally at peace and his spirit is free.

"So don't cry, baby, this one's for you." While that's clearly a tribute to her late "beloved," it's also a reference to one of Ricki's film roles. Though she was most known for her role as Tracy Turnblad in Hairspray, Ricki also starred alongside Johnny Depp in another John Waters cult classic: Cry Baby.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Universal Pictures</span></figure><p>That's enough to seal it for us, but what turned out 99 percent positivity to 100 was this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video of Ricki singing</a> "Suddenly Seymour" with Cheyenne Jackson at Birdland Jazz Club in NYC.
