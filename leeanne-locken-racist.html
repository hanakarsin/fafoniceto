While Kary was wearing the dress at dinner, she gossiped with the other ladies about what alterations to the dress' design she thought would make it better, and it clearly started some drama between the two of them — resulting in some choice words were thrown around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BRAvo</span></figure><p>In response to Kary's comments, LeeAnne had some derogatory comments she threw back at Kary, insulting her Mexican heritage. LeeAnne called Kary a “chirpy Mexican," continuing with '"Come on, Mexican! I thought you were all Mexican and strong."</p><p>Clearly, there were some shots fired here, and it created a lot of tension within the house. A producer even asked fellow housewife Brandi if she thinks LeeAnne is racist, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandi simply sighs in response</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">LeeAnne wants to clear her name and is looking for a "shakeup."</h2><p>Now that the season is almost over, LeeAnne has finally addressed her comments, claiming that she's not racist.</p><p>"Everything I do in my life, anybody who knows me anywhere around the country — from WeHo to Dallas — knows that I believe in inclusion and equality, and I will fight and die for making that happen," LeeAnne told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>. "I don't know how you can have that label and an 'ally' label. And I tell you what, I love my ally label and I'll never lose it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Whether or not LeeAnne is actually an "ally" though, has yet to be clear this season, but she's certain that she's just being targeted right now and doesn't really have anything to clear up.</p><p>"I don't think there's a No. 1 [thing] for me [to clear up]," she said of the reunion. "I mean, that's what happens when you're, like, the, you know, the target sign … &nbsp;So, like the bullseye, obviously, would be the label they're trying to give me, but there's still outer realms of my negativity, or this or that, and I have a lot of really great points I'm excited to make. And I really can't wait to make them."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will there be a RHOD Season 5?&nbsp;</h2><p>Real Housewives of Dallas hasn't been renewed for its fifth season yet, and it's rumored that some of the cast members might be replaced after this season, since the show is reportedly putting out casting flyers. But LeeAnna says she would also welcome some changes in the show's cast.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"You know that tornado that came through my neighborhood?
