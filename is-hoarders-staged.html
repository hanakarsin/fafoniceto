Docuseries psychologist speaks on the reality of the show.</h2><p>"I can unequivocally tell you that nothing is staged," Dr. Zasio told Distractify (via phone). In fact, the psychologist explained that when she arrives at a client's home, she has not yet been inside. Therefore, the cameras are capturing a very genuine reaction.</p><p>"It’s all natural. It’s unscripted and it’s exactly as individuals see it," Dr. Zasio added. "I think the reason why this question is so incredibly important is because what the viewers are seeing is the reality of other people in our society who are struggling at that very level and they’re living at that very level of hoarding. The conditions can be unsanitary and unsafe and even deadly in certain circumstances..."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><p>According to the psychologist, the show is attempting to educate viewers who may not have access to certain resources.</p><p>"If you look back [to] when the show started, we didn’t really see or know much about hoarding disorder because people lived in silence; they were isolated. They were scared. They were shameful. They were fearful of what was going to happen if someone came into their home," Dr. Zasio explained, adding, "Hoarding disorder is something that is becoming more prominent and pronounced in the community, which I firmly believe is because of the Hoarders show."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happens to patients after the 'Hoarders' team leaves?</h2><p>According to Dr. Zasio, extreme hoarding behavior "is usually a symptom of something else going on." The clinical psychologist explained that "depression" is frequently present in a person struggling with hoarding disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Dr. Zasio explained that treating someone with this behavior is "very individualized" and other ongoing issues need to be addressed to understand "why [a patient is] having difficulty accumulating and letting go."</p><p>When attempting to treat a patient, Dr. Zasio explained that she initially researches the area and looks for other professionals who are trained in hoarding behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"From the very beginning when I’m assigned to work with someone, I am already researching the area and looking for resources," she told Distractify. &nbsp;Then, after the A&E crew leaves, patients are able to get help from a trained specialist to continue with their treatment and follow-up care. Dr. Zasio concluded, "This is not about a clean-up, this is much deeper."</p><p>New episodes of Hoarders air Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButM6aqZ2doqh6tMDAoJyd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-saraki-urges-youth-to-participate-in-politics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Saraki Urges Youth To Participate In Politics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oxlades-ku-lo-sa-enroute-to-becoming-a-global-smash-hit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oxlades Ku Lo Sa Enroute To Becoming A Global Smash Hit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
