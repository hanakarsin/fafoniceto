Though Elon is arguably better recognized for fathering children with popular musician Grimes, she has only given birth to three of his 12 total offspring. Let's break down who each of his baby mamas are (and how many children he has with each).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Baby mama No.1 ‚Äî Justine Musk.</h2><p>Elon's first baby mama is none other than his first wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justine Musk</a> (n√©e Wilson).</p><p>She is a Canadian author, best known for her 2005 contemporary fantasy novel, BloodAngel. The pair met while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, and eventually tied the knot in January 2000.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X / @justinemusk</a></figure><p>In 2002, Elon and Justine welcomed their first child, Nevada Alexander; however, their son died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome at just 10 weeks old. After losing their firstborn, the former couple turned to IVF. In 2004, Justine gave birth to twins Griffin and Vivian. Two years later, the novelist gave birth to triplets ‚Äî Kai, Saxon, and Damian ‚Äî via IVF.</p><p>Elon and Justine divorced in 2008.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Baby mama No.2 ‚Äî Claire Boucher, aka Grimes.</h2><p>Following his split from actress <a href=#>Amber Heard</a>, the Tesla CEO began dating Canadian singer Grimes in May 2018. She's released five studio albums, amassing a large fandom due to her eccentricity and versatility as an artist.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, the former couple met via Twitter after discovering that they both tweeted the same pun relating to Rococo and the thought experiment Roko's basilisk. Wow, talk about an unexpected pairing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In May 2020, Grimes gave birth to her and Elon's son, X AE A-Xii. He was initially named X √Ü A-12, but his name was changed to adhere to California's naming laws.</p><p>Elon and Grimes broke up in September 2021; however, the "Genesis" vocalist revealed in March 2022 that she and the 51-year-old billionaire welcomed baby No. 2, a daughter called Exa Dark Sider√¶l, via surrogate. In 2023, they welcomed their third child, Techno Mechanicus.</p><p>The exact timeline of Elon's relationship with Grimes is a bit unclear, though it's obvious that while they were seeing each other, Elon was also seeing baby mama No. 3, as the birth dates for many of the singers' children overlaps with Elon's other new additions to the family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Baby mama No.3 ‚Äî Shivon Zilis.</h2><p>On July 6, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> reported that Elon welcomed twins in November 2021 with one of his top Neuralink executives, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shivon Zilis</a>. According to the court documents obtained by the outlet, the pair requested to change their children's names to "have their father‚Äôs last name and contain their mother‚Äôs last name as part of their middle name."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The best high fives üôåüèæ‚ô•Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jnxdHRYZeY</a></p>‚Äî Shivon Zilis (@shivon) <a href=#>June 11, 2024</a></figure><p>The founder and CEO of SpaceX has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly stated</a> following the birth of his first children with Shivon that he's "Doing [his] best to help the underpopulation crisis," arguing that "a collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far."</p><p>In June 2024, Elon confirmed that he and Shivon welcomed another child, though did not disclose the child's name or gender.</p><p>"All our friends and family know. Failure to issue a press release, which would be bizarre, does not mean 'secret.," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> of the most recent birth.</p><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Twitter account</a>, Shivon hails from Canada but currently resides in San Francisco. She attended Yale, studying economics and philosophy; she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played on the ice hockey team</a> as the goalie before graduating in 2008.</p><p>Since then, Shivon has climbed her wait to the top of the corporate chain. She currently serves as the director of operations and special projects for Neuralink. She is also a board member for OpenAI.</p><p>Shivon worked as the project director for Tesla from May 2017 to August 2019 ‚Äî per her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, she worked on all of the AI projects. Perhaps that is how she met her baby daddy! Just how involved Elon is in these kids' lives isn't known, though it's safe to say 12 children is a lot to handle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmwuoymrKyjXZeuo8WMppimmaM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./n1-8bn-debt-amcon-takes-over-aeroland-travels-assets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>AMCON Takes Over Aeroland Travels Assets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./troll-train-shaved-legs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>This Wrong Number Text Resulted in One of the Most Savage Trolls of All Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
