Through the years, both 19 Kids & Counting and <a href=#>Counting On</a> have focused on the highly conservative couple (and now their adult kids) endlessly welcoming babies. The general consensus among them is to leave the number of children they have "up to God." So you can imagine why <a href=#>Jill Duggar'</a>s comments about using <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">birth contro</a>l are so shocking.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what Jill has said about birth control and whether she wants more children in the future — along with clarifying the former Counting On star's comments about non-hormonal birth control in particular.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Jill Duggar use birth control?</h2><p>"Yes, we use birth control," Jill — who shares two sons, Israel and Samuel, with husband Derick Dillard — revealed during a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Q&A video published to her YouTube channel</a> on Sept. 30. "But we prefer to use non-hormonal birth control methods and just because we don't want to use anything that could potentially cause an abortion."</p><p>She continued, "I think there are probably uses for hormonal methods of birth control for, like, regulating things and stuff like that. But for us, we just want to be careful about that. And we're also more natural minded, so I know sometimes there can be more longer-lasting effects from hormonal birth control and stuff like that. So we just steer clear of those."</p><p>"I try not to get all out of whack with my hormones," Derick jokingly interjected.</p><p>Jill added, "Eventually, we want to have more kids and stuff, Lord willing. So we don't want to mess too much with all of that and potentially cause problems."</p><p>"We'll probably stop using birth control whenever we wanted to get pregnant," Derick again joked. (Gee, really?)</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: Dillard Family Official/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Wait, what is considered non-hormonal birth control anyway?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-hormonal birth control</a> methods include options like condoms, sponges, cervical caps, diaphragms, spermicide, copper IUD, and natural family planning. This means Jill and Derick don't use birth control methods such as oral contraceptives, a vaginal ring, a contraceptive skin patch, and hormone-releasing IUDs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have shunned birth control.</h2><p>The Tontitown, Ark., couple discussed their decision not to use birth control during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode of 19 Kids & Counting</a>.</p><p>"When Michelle and I first got married, we thought maybe we would want one, or two, or three children — but we didn't want children when we first got married," Jim Bob said at the time. "And so Michelle went on the birth control pill."</p><p>Jim Bob went on to explain that Michelle remained on the pill for roughly three years until they decided they wanted to have children. They welcomed their first son Josh in 1988, and then Michelle went back on the pill.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"I ended up getting pregnant while on the pill and we ended up losing that baby," Michelle said. "And that was very difficult for us because here we were parents, holding this one baby in our arms, enjoying being a mama and a daddy — and then realizing with our own lack of knowledge, just allowing one of our own little babies to be destroyed. That was painful."</p><p>"We just really felt like that we needed to give this area of our life to God," Jim Bob concluded.</p><p>Michelle continued, "We gave that area of our life to the Lord and right after that, God blessed us with twins." (Those twins were Jana and John David, for the record, who were followed by 16 more siblings over a span of 20 years.)</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Clearly, Jill and Derick Dillard have chosen a family planning path that doesn't align with Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's approach. But that's absolutely their decision to make. (And yes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their views concerning hormonal birth control </a>may be slightly misinformed.) It'll be interesting to see whether other Duggar siblings eventually address their views on contraception, considering Counting On fans have speculated that <a href=#>Jinger and Jeremy Vuolo have used birth control as well</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, kudos to Jill and Derick for making their own decisions about family planning — even if it does go against what Jill's fundamental Christian family believes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7atuIydrKCfkad6o7XRrZ9mm5%2BjwbO7yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./muslim-muslim-ticket-osinbajo-is-more-qualified-than-tinubu-babachir-lawal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Muslim-Muslim Ticket: Osinbajo Is More Qualified Than Tinubu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jaws-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jaws - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
