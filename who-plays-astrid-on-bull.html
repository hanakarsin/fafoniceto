Astrid was kidnapped in the Season 6 premiere, but she wasn't the only character missing. What happened to Benny?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Season 6, Episode 1 of </strong><strong>Bull.</strong></p><p>The fall premiere of Season 6 of <a href=#>Bull</a> comes only months after the Season 5 finale. When we last saw the titular character and the TAC team, their lives were in shambles. Benny’s run for district attorney went awry, much like <a href=#>Izzy and Bull’s</a> wedding plans.</p><p>In the Season 6 premiere, things finally seemed to be looking up for the cast. That was until a toddler went missing. Bull and his team spend the beginning of Season 6 searching for this little girl. But who plays Astrid, and what’s her connection to Bull?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays Astrid on 'Bull'? Meet Jason Bull and Izzy Colón’s daughter.</h2><p>Longtime viewers of the series remember when we were introduced to Bull’s wife in Season 1. Izzy was slated as a recurring character until she and Bull welcomed their daughter and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yara Martinez</a> joined the show full-time. Although it took quite a while for Bull and Izzy to choose a name for their baby girl, they ultimately decided on Astrid.</p><p>A CGI baby played Astrid in Season 5, but it seems she's since been replaced by a real, unnamed toddler.</p><p>Although Izzy was sometimes apathetic towards her pregnancy ahead of Astrid’s birth, her motherly instinct certainly kicks in during the Season 6 opener. After returning home from a company celebration, Izzy and Bull discover that their nanny has been tied up and their baby is nowhere to be found.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>In a frenzy, Izzy and Bull disagree about how to find their daughter’s kidnapper. While Izzy insists that they recruit the police to help find Izzy, Bull believes in his team. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>, actress Yara explained what Astrid’s disappearance could mean for Izzy and Bull’s relationship in Season 6.</p><p>“We just come in hot after that. it’s extremely intense,” Yara said of the Season 6 premiere. “[You] see this different side of Bull, and Michael as an actor — I don’t think he’s brought anything like this before.”</p><p>In Season 4, showrunners gave us a glimpse of an adult Astrid, who was expecting a child of her own, in a short-lived time jump. It’s safe to say that their daughter will survive this stint, but according to Yara, Astrid’s disappearance is only one of the obstacles they are forced to overcome in the upcoming season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>“Bull and Izzy are really going through it this season. But at the same time, they just want to get through it together. They still have that banter. They still make each other laugh,” the Bull actress shared.</p><p>But Astrid wasn’t the only character missing in the Season 6 premiere of Bull. So, <a href=#>what happened to Benny</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Benny on ‘Bull’? Details on Freddy Rodriguez’s exit from the series.</h2><p>The Season 6 premiere of Bull revealed that Benny left the team — and the country — in pursuit of the woman of his dreams. After his departure from New York, Benny traveled to Rome to be with his new wife and we couldn’t be happier for him.</p><p>It was announced that <a href=#>Freddy Rodriguez</a> would be leaving the show following the Season 5 finale due to an internal investigation. CBS declined to comment on the matter further.</p><p>See if Izzy and Bull get baby Astrid back on Bull, which airs Thursdays at 11 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXZbAtb7InWSopl2Xwq24</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./air-peace-arik-air-dana-others-increase-ticket-prices.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Air Peace, Arik Air, Dana, Others Increase Ticket Prices</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pope-benedict-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Pope Benedict Today?
