Many who have paid close attention to the story have focused in particular on Carlee's search history, which seems to suggest she may have taken steps to orchestrate her own disappearance in the days leading up to actually going missing.</p><p>As we try to unpack all the details in this strange case, many are also making fun of Carlee because of some of the things she took the time to look up. One of the most notable queries was "Do you have to pay for an <a href=#>Amber Alert</a>?" Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Carlee searched 'Do you have to pay for an Amber Alert?'</h2><p>Carlee reportedly went missing for 48 hours in Alabama after she called 911 to report that a toddler was walking alone on the side of the highway. Police said that they haven't found any evidence that there was actually a toddler on I-459, which is where Carlee disappeared from after making her call. Also, police said that Carlee's search history prior to her disappearance was suspicious.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Among the searches that raised a red flag was "Do you have to pay for an Amber Alert?" The answer to that question is of course no, but Carlee's search led many to suspect that she had orchestrated her own disappearance.</p><p>Carlee reappeared at her parent's home on July 15, 2023, and police have spent the days since laying out the case that Carlee orchestrated this disappearance all by herself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Carlee also searched whether there was an age limit on Amber Alerts.</h2><p>In addition to her search about whether you had to pay for an Amber Alert, Carlee also searched whether there was an age limit on Amber Alerts, and a bunch of other suspicious terms.</p><p>According to police, she searched all of the following: “How to take money from a register without being caught,” “Do you have to pay for an Amber Alert?,” “Birmingham Bus station,” “one-way bus ticket from Birmingham to Nashville,” and “the maximum age of an Amber Alert.”</p><p>Amber Alerts are issued by police when they believe a child is in danger, and adults don't qualify for them.</p><p>People who are following the case online absolutely slammed Carlee after they discovered that she may have faked her own disappearance. They were also savage about the fact that she apparently stopped at Target for snacks before she went off the grid.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Searches Carlee Russell did on her phone in the days/hours leading up to her disappearance:</p><p>"Do you have to pay for amber alerts"</p><p>"How to take money from a register"</p><p>"Birmingham bus station"</p><p>"One way ticket Birmingham to Nashville"</p><p>"The movie Taken"</p><p>"maximum age for…</p>— chris evans (@notcapnamerica) <a href=#>July 19, 2023</a></figure><p>"Really, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">#CarleeRussell</a>? Just why? And who hasn’t watched enough crime documentaries and shows to know your 'Google' search and phone records will be one of the first to be retrieved? How could you when it’s already hard to get attention on missing minorities?" one person wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Carlee's family is still adamant that she was abducted, but local police say they have yet to find any evidence of a crime. Police are still waiting to interview Carlee. They haven't officially charged her with any crime yet. The internet may have convicted her already, but she hasn't faced any legal accountability as of this writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxuxc6uZKGZppp6tbuMqZiyZZakv26tzWaYppqVp3qiuMSrqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1427732-much-talented-barber-life-burna-boy-a-fine-haricut-photos-viral-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Much Talented Young Nigerian Barber Makes It in Life, Gives Burna Boy Fine Haircut, Photos Go Viral</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./apc-youth-leader-shot-dead-in-enugu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>APC Youth Leader Shot Dead In Enugu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
