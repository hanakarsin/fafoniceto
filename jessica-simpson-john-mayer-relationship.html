John was coming off of relationships with singer Vanessa Carlton and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, who “Your Body is a Wonderland” is rumored to be about, although Jennifer recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> that this was the case.&nbsp;</p><p>New details from Jessica's memoir suggest that John was obsessed with her — both physically and emotionally. John seemed to confirm this was true during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playboy</a> in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, John said that Jessica was like “crack cocaine” to him, before adding, “Sexually, it was crazy. That's all I'll say. It was like napalm, sexual napalm.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jessica and John in 2007.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jessica was hurt by John's candid Playboy interview.</h2><p>Although John may have thought that he was paying his ex a compliment by describing her that way, Jessica had a very different <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reaction</a> to his Playboy interview.&nbsp;</p><p>"He thought that was what I wanted to be called," Jessica wrote in her memoir.&nbsp;"I was floored and embarrassed that my grandmother was actually gonna read that."</p><p>If the relationship hadn’t already ended, Jessica likely would have called it quits with John at that point. Two years after the Playboy interview, Mayer admitted that he regretted the comment in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>. “I had nothing to say,“ Mayer said. “I was going through a time in my life where I didn't really want to share what was going on, but I didn't want to be boring."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jessica claims John caused her to drink more.</h2><p>In her memoir, the blonde beauty also explains that she didn’t think she was actually smart enough to date John. "My anxiety would spike and I would pour another drink. It was the start of me relying on alcohol to mask my nerves,” she writes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jessica and John in 2007.</p></figure><p>Although it likely wasn’t his intention, it seems Jessica's relationship with John may have actually<a href=#> fueled her addiction. </a>Jessica also claims that, over the course of their relationship, they broke up and got back together roughly nine times.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were great at intimacy,” she said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Hoda Kotb. “We were great at loving each other. That was easy, but the relationship was very complex.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does John think of Jessica's memoir?</h2><p>Although they’ve been broken up for more than a decade, Jessica does reveal a fair number of personal details about her time with John. Still, the mother-of-three doesn’t seem to think that anything in the book will come as a huge shock to her ex.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t think he’ll be shocked,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. “He knows these stories.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Jessica is candid in the book about her struggles with alcohol and pills, but, as she recently told the publication, she doesn’t care what John thinks about her history.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7K0v8icmGarmaK9tLvNZqGooJ5iuqLFxKtkq52clsGqu82sn6Ko</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./418662-mke-mwema-dp-ruto-asema-mkewe-rachael-ni-kama-malaika-nguzo-ya-jamii-yake-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mke Mwema: DP Ruto Asema Mkewe Rachael ni Kama Malaika, Nguzo ya Jamii Yake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dungeons-and-dragons-movie-easter-eggs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are the Easter Eggs You May Have Missed in the 'Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons' Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
