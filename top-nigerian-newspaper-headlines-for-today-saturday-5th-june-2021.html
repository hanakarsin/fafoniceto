You know these people (bandits) need engagements from the government itself. If you dialogue with them without the involvement of the government, it is a problem,”&nbsp;Gumi said.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday presided over a police council meeting at the presidential villa.</p><p>Usman Baba during the meeting was confirmed as the Inspector-General of Police.</p><p>The development was confirmed to State House correspondents at the end of the meeting by the Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi.</p><p>Recall that Buhari had on April 6 appointed Baba as acting IGP.</p><p>The overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has stated that Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho and other agitation will drop their grievance when they see things getting better in the country.</p><p>Naija News reports that Sunday Igboho and other Yoruba youths have been calling for the creation a separate nation called Oduduwa Republic (Oodua).</p><p>Speaking to BBC Yoruba, Tunde Bakare said such agitations are a result of the state of affairs in the country.</p><p>“I have never seen Sunday Igboho. This is the time he is supposed to come see me but he is unable to come. But he has met with some prominent Nigerians,” he said.</p><p>Former Ondo State Governor, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has debunked reports that he is planning to dump the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>Reports had emerged that the former governor had concluded plans to join the ruling APC.</p><p>Mimiko is said to have held series of meetings in Abuja with the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, the Chairman of the APC National Caretaker Committee and governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni as well as two other governors to prepare the ground for his defection to APC.</p><p>Sources had also claimed that part of the reasons the APC leadership wants Mimiko to join the party is because they feel the incumbent Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu is opposing the federal government on some national issues and seems not to be on the same page with the Villa.</p><p>Bandits group responsible for the abduction of 156 Islamiyya students in Niger State have demanded N200 million ransom.</p><p>Recall that bandits on May 27 invaded Salihu Tanko Islamiyya school in Tegina town, Rafi LGA, and abducted several schoolchildren.</p><p>The bandits on Wednesday had demanded N110 million ransom for the kidnapped pupils.</p><p>However, the bandits have increased the ransom to N200 million to secure the release of the pupils.</p><p>The school headmaster, Abubakar Alhassan, and a parent of two of the abducted children made the revelation while speaking with Arise TV on Friday.</p><p>Nigeria’s Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has reportedly paid a surprise visit to ex-militant leader, High Chief Government Ekpemupolo, popularly known as Tompolo, at his Oporoza, Gbaramatu Kingdom country home in Delta State.</p><p>Recall that Tompolo had in a statement on Sunday noted that the current scenario in which a sole administrator controls the affairs of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is no longer acceptable to the stakeholders.</p><p>He called on President Muhammadu Buhari, members of the National Assembly and all others concerned to ensure a substantive board is set up within seven days or he will embark on destructive activities that will target crude oil exploration and exploitation activities in the Niger Delta region.</p><p>Yoruba freedom fighter and activist, Sunday Igboho Adeyemo, has escaped an attack by armed gunmen at his Soka residence, Ibadan, in Oyo state.</p><p>Naija News reports that the attack was made known Igboho’s spokespersons, Koiki Olayomi and Dapo Salami.</p><p>His aides revealed that the attackers stormed the house around 1:30 am and attempted to set it ablaze but they were resisted by the vigilant security aides of Igboho.</p><p>It was gathered that the gunmen and the guards of the activists exchanged gunfire.</p><h2><strong>That’s the top Nig</strong><strong>erian newspaper headl</strong><strong>in</strong><strong>es f</strong><strong>or to</strong><strong>day.
