While at IHOP on central here in Hot springs Arkansas, William was on the table coloring playing and waiting for his food when the general manager came over and told us he couldn’t be there because he can’t touch the syrup that was on the table! I as a protecting mother snapped back quick and asked what the difference was from hands to feet. She told me that she worked at first step and wasn’t trying to offend us, what does first step even have to do with the situation, just cause you work there doesn’t mean you understand children with disabilities or care for them. She proceeded to ask me if he walked. Yes my son walks you idiot! But I carried him in took him to the bathroom and washed his feet so he could eat and she said she didn’t see that happen. Do you go around and ask every customer if they washed there hands before they touch the syrup no you don’t! There was lots of words passed back and forth about the situation! Then the whole staff proceeded to talk about how my kids straw wrappers where on the floor and talk about my son. He is a three year old innocent child that does things different. Big shout out to the veteran that was there with two women that left when we did and stood up for my son. And there food had just got to there table and they left. Also to the family with the baseball players who when asked if the kids washed there hands and they replied no the dad passed the syrup around for every kid to touch the syrup! In the end we left without eating or paying for our drinks. I did make it aware to everyone in the restaurant that my son was being discriminated for having no arms and I wanted the corporate number which they could not provide because they said they didn’t have it. I hope karma gets you for what u did to my child!!!!!!!!<br>Gerneral Manager: Angie<br></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#onepissedoffmom</a><p>—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexis Bancroft</a></p><p>Social media users were upset at the way the Bancrofts were treated.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>I will not!
