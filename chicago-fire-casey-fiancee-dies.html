Viewers may recall that the physician was initially believed to have been killed in a fire at the clinic, but it was later determined that she had been hit in the back of the head before the blaze started.</p><p>Casey comes to find out that Timothy Campbell murdered Hallie after she accidentally stumbled across a drug trafficking hub operating within the clinic. The fire was set to cover up the killing.</p><p>In a 2013 interview, Jesse Spencer — who plays Casey on the series — revealed how the firefighter was feeling after such a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">devastating loss</a>. "The general gist is that Casey is coming back after a month’s hiatus, a month’s break," the actor explained back in Season 2.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"He’s coming back in an attempt to really try and overcome what he’s been through, and the best way is to put his head down and try to make it work by force," Jesse added.

"Coming back to the show was a homecoming for me," the brunette beauty told Entertainment Weekly.&nbsp;</p><p>"The cast of Chicago Fire will always be my family, and it was so wonderful to work with them again. It was such a positive experience returning to the family, and I’m so happy and grateful for a chance to work with all of them again!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Monica originally left the drama series after Season 6, stating that it was time for her "to move on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the next chapter</a> in life." Dawsey stans were devastated by the news, but the actress teased that her upcoming guest appearance in Episode 9 should satisfy all the romantics out there.</p><p>"Fans can expect sparks to fly from the Dawson and Casey reunion," the 33-year-old shared. "Dawson and Casey will always have an unbreakable bond, and their love is a special love that I think will forever stay alive.
