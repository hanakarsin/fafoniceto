Alex Ekubo and his ex-fiance, Fancy Acholonu, as their private chats have emerged online.</h2><p><a href=#><strong>Naija News</strong></a> reports that the former lovebirds have been making headlines following Fancy’s public apology about their failed wedding which she later claimed Alex forced her to put up online.</p><p>In the series of chats that emerged online, Fancy claimed everything seemed wrong in their relationship despite spending five years together.</p><p>A part of the chat alleged that Fancy was verbally and emotionally abused after their relationship was made public and they never got intimate.</p><p>In a conversation with Alex, Fancy analyzed how she wanted an intimate wedding but the actor was pushing to a lavish ceremony because of his colleagues.</p><p>The American model who seemed unable to contain the issues with <a href=# rel=noopener>Alex Ekubo</a> told him she was calling off their wedding and he responded by saying the issue must not get to the internet.</p><p>See chats below:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alex-1.jpeg alt width=720 height=829 sizes="(max-width: 720px)
