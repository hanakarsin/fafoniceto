There was a clear attempt to create a narrative that no one was buying, and <a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a>'s tears were better suited for the banks of the Nile River than for garnering sympathy. This situation — while perhaps morally easy to judge — has become a legal nightmare.</p><p>After Tom lodged a lawsuit against Ariana on July 16, 2024, per legal documents obtained by Distractify, fans grew so incensed that a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> was created to have him permanently removed from the network and all of its programming. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter roundup</a> accounts have shared tweets that also showcase viewer discontent. But it seems Tom's lawsuit against Ariana was a big misunderstanding and he is now having it dismissed. Here are the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why is Tom Sandoval suing Ariana Madix?</h2><p>According to court documents viewed by Distractify, Tom filed suit against Ariana on July 18, 2024, for "invasion of privacy, negligence, and unauthorized computer access." This is in reference to the incident in which Ariana discovered Tom was cheating on her with <a href=#>Rachel Leviss</a> and ran off with his phone.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tom Sandoval took to Instagram to announce he is throwing out the lawsuit against Ariana.</h2><p>On July 18, 2024, two days after his lawsuit was filed, Tom announced in a lengthy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Instagram</a> that the lawsuit lodged against Ariana would be thrown out. Tom claims that after his lawyer, Matt Geragos, called him regarding the cross-complaint in the lawsuit, he was assured “the action was customary and strictly preventative in these types of lawsuits and urged me to agree to it.” Tom says the terms “New Lawsuit” and “Suing” were “not articulated” to him and he acknowledges that he should have “done more of my due diligence on the matter.”</p><p>His message continued, “Upon realizing what this action actually means, I have removed Matt Geragos from my legal team. In no way am I suing Ariana.” He added that the action against Ariana is being withdrawn, hoping both he and Ariana can resolve the case quickly and move on with their lives.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Thomas Sandoval (@tomsandoval1)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nonetheless, Scandoval has created a convoluted legal nightmare.</h2><p>The legal system is not easy to navigate, especially considering all of the lawsuits brought forth by this situation. Scandoval has created a legal nightmare for those representing Ariana, Rachel, and Tom. Ariana is suing Tom for refusing to put their house on the market. <a href=#>Rachel is suing Tom and Ariana</a> for eavesdropping, revenge porn, and invasion of privacy. While Tom's lawsuit would have created an even bigger problem for everyone involved, thankfully, it’s now one less issue to address.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Would Tom have had a chance of winning this lawsuit against Ariana?</h2><p>Given the lawsuit appears to be a misunderstanding, hypothetically speaking, filing it seems like a reckless decision. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">California's privacy laws</a> are stringent, and in Tom's case, the incident began when Ariana was given his phone for safekeeping after he dropped it. This situation negates any reasonable expectation of privacy, as the phone was intentionally placed in her care.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tom's inconsistent attitude about the aftermath of his misdeeds would not have helped his case.</h2><p>One receipt fans were quick to bring out was when Tom called Rachel a monster for suing Ariana. This clip would have removed legitimacy from his personal claims against Ariana, as he has gone from referring to her as the victim to the perpetrator, which would have made him look inconsistent.</p><p>It also doesn't help that there is over a decade's worth of footage that <a href=#>shows him lying</a> in a variety of situations. It shows that he has a pattern of inconsistent behavior, which would have weakened his case pretty significantly.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tom's lawsuit against Ariana could have made things easier for Rachel in her case against him.</h2><p>Since the lawsuit has been dropped and was a misunderstanding, California's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unclean Hands Doctrine</a> could have applied to Tom's case. There is substantial footage showing habitual evidence, which could have been damaging given his <a href=#>history of infidelity</a>. The lawsuit might have been a misguided move, potentially benefiting Rachel's case instead. Tom's recording of videos without Rachel's consent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">violated California's two-party consent law</a>, and such evidence could have been used against him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZK2nnWLAorrDqK2apF2owqq6xmaYq6GRo65uucCdoLE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./entertainment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Entertainment | Distractify.com</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-meyer-judy-garland.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Meyer and Judy Garland Dated Briefly Before Her Death: Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
