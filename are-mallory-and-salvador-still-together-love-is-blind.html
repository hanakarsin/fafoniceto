The two met in the pods on 'Love Is Blind' Season 2, and they ended up getting engaged.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Season 2 of </strong><strong>Love Is Blind.</strong></p><p>The first five episodes of <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 2</a> dropped on <a href=#>Netflix</a> on Feb. 11, and fans quickly got to know a set of <a href=#>Chicago-based singletons</a> as they navigated the mysterious pod speed-dating process.</p><p>The show followed six couples who forged strong enough connections to get engaged. While pairs like <a href=#>Shayne Jansen with Natalie Lee</a> and <a href=#>Abhishek "Shake" Chatterjee with Deepti Vempati</a> have polarized fans, other duos have renewed viewers' faith in the process.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Sal and Mal on 'Love Is Blind' Season 2.</p></figure><p>Mallory Zapata and Salvador "Sal" Perez (couple name: Sallory) got engaged after a few <a href=#>days of intense pod discussions</a> and, though their journey to the altar hasn't been entirely smooth sailing, many were hoping that they would be one of the pairs to swap vows on the Feb. 25 finale.</p><p>Are Sal and Mallory still together after <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a>? Read on for the refresher on their love story, whether they said "I do" on their wedding day, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Mallory and Salvador get married on 'Love Is Blind'?</h2><p>Though Mallory connected in the pods with <a href=#>Jarrette Jones</a> (and even came up with the JerBear nickname for him), she ultimately told the project manager that her feelings for Sal were stronger.</p><p>In the third episode ("Love in Paradise"), Sal popped the question with a heartfelt proposal.</p><p>"I know that you will take nothing more than my best, and I love how you bring out my most thoughtful, my most vulnerable version, because you deserve nothing less. You deserve that. You literally have my best in your hands right now, and falling in love with you has changed me as a person," Sal said as the two were still separated by a wall. "Mallory, will you marry me?" Mal, as we know, said yes.</p><p>When the six couples went to Mexico for a mini-vacation before their lives in the "real world" picked back up, Mallory and Sal were able to connect on a deeper level.</p><p>However, once the engaged duos all met up for the first time, Mallory spent quite a while engaging in a one-on-one discussion with her pod flame, Jarrette.</p><p>The fifth episode concluded with Sal confronting Mallory about a comment she made regarding her hesitations about getting married.</p><p>So, what happened when Mallory and Sal made it down the aisle? They did NOT end up getting married.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened on Mal and Sal's wedding day?</h2><p>The wedding day for Mallory and Sal ended with some tears. When the priest asked Sal whether or not he was ready to commit to her, he said, “I cannot.” It was honestly quite shocking to see since he was the one who seemed fully invested in the process. He was the one who was acting totally in love with Mallory from the moment they started interacting in the pods.</p><p>He revealed to her at the altar that he felt he needed more time. She reassured him it was okay before dashing away in her wedding gown. After all their guests parted ways, they approached each other for a gentle conversation to go over the heartbreaking shared experience. He told her his reasoning for waiting until they were at the altar to break things off is that he wasn’t ready to make a final decision until the actual wedding day.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Mallory and Salvador still together after 'Love Is Blind'?</h2><p>Even though they broke up in front of all their friends and family, it seems they ended things on a positive note. The two even discussed possibly going on a date together in the future. Looks like we'll have to wait for the reunion episode to find out whether the two decided to continue pursuing a relationship with each other. If their Instagram accounts are anything to go by, we don't have any hints or news to go by just yet.</p><p>Seasons 1 and 2 of Love Is Blind are available for streaming on Netflix. The reunion episode for Season 2 airs on March 4, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bmecyao6Wnoq56orrDZqqapKaWsbC%2BjKyroqScYsGws8Stn56qXaG8t7GMoqpmmpyeu6U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colleen-hoover-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Colleen Hoover - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexander-wange-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexander Wang - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
