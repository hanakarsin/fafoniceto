Scroll down for an update on the reality stars.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Paul from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way get deported?</h2><p>TLC has yet to reveal on the show if Paul was deported, but things aren’t looking good for the American. On a recent episode, he was understandably upset to find out that his application for permanent residency in Brazil had been rejected because "of [an] act of terrorism for [a] crime of aggression."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He visited a lawyer in an attempt to figure out what was going on and learned that the issue stemmed from a "terroristic threatening" charge he received in Kentucky 13 years ago. The Portuguese translation failed to clarify that the charge is a misdemeanor in the States and not an actual threat of terrorism.</p><p>"It’s going to be very hard to change this decision," Paul’s lawyer confessed, but agreed to file an appeal on his behalf.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It’s confirmed that Paul’s visa was denied due to his criminal history.</h2><p>The 36-year-old explained why he was charged with terroristic threatening more than a decade ago. "I got home from work and I found out my girlfriend was in there with another guy," Paul told the camera. "So yeah, I threatened to slash his tires. I made some angry comments."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>But that’s not the only run-in he’s had with the law. When he appeared with Karine on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days back in 2017, Paul admitted that he was accused of arson 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was incarcerated pending trial for 18 months until I took a plea agreement and got on probation," he shared. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starcasm</a>, Paul was convicted of burning personal property to defraud an insurer in 2014, seven years after he was said to have committed the second degree arson.&nbsp;</p><p>He was also charged with violating a Kentucky emergency protective order in 2013, which he also addressed on Before the 90 Days.</p><p>"One of the relationships I was in ended so badly, it ended up getting me in some serious trouble," he told the camera. "My ex-girlfriend and I both took out restraining orders against each other. And I ended up sending her a text message, which directly violated that order. So I got locked back up over it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are Paul and Karine living now?</h2><p>A 90 Day Fiancé Instagram fan page suggests that the couple, who welcomed son Pierre in March, is currently living in the States. This might confirm that Paul was, in fact, deported.</p><p>"They recently posted pictures of them at what looks like the Louisville zoo," the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@90dayfiancenews account</a> wrote on June 12. "People have also spotted them at restaurants in the area."</p><p>Watch Paul’s legal troubles continue to play out on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, airing Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalec%2BarKVll5rBbrDEqaarrJWZenp8jJ2YsmWWnq6vr8Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lilimar-hernandez-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lilimar - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tooturnttoni-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tooturnttony - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
