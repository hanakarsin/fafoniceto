The troll, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Butane online</a>, decided to have some fun with this dude.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>It's pretty clear that either our lustful texter typed in a number different from the one Lynn gave him, or Lynn, not wanting to deal with the awkwardness of outright rejecting a dude, gave him the wrong phone number. It happens.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>What usually doesn't happen is that you get a guy who's willing to shave his own legs just to troll you into thinking a girl is coming over to your house for some drinks and possible hanky-panky.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Michael, at the very least, made sure the guy didn't waste any gas or time driving in the car with his elaborate prank. In fact, he took the brunt of the punishment by shaving his right leg for the joke. The trollee, however, didn't appreciate the craft and consideration that went into it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Even though Michael brought up some very good points about the fact that it could've ended much, much worse for the trolled dude, our original texter and Lynn-admirer couldn't take the jest in good spirits.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>I'd also chalk up the guy's grammatical deficiencies due to him being extremely angry or nonplussed, but he was texting like a moron even before he got trolled to high heaven, so as much as I hate grammar, I'm gonna have to side with Michael in the following exchange.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Michael tries to draw the troll into yet another gag by promising to give the dude "information" on Lynn, and for a second, it seems like the hopeful guy is going to fall for it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>But he's either too hurt or weirded out by Michael's antics to allow himself to get played again.

Plus, the dude can't spell correctly in a day and age where everyone's got a smartphone and autocorrect which, as wonky as it is, pretty much autocapitalizes and formats your sentences for you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Michael seems to enjoy taking passengers for rides on the "Troll Train," he's posted some other interactions with various men who are hoping to hook up with an attractive lady.</p><p>I'm assuming he set up a fake dating profile account and put his phone number online to lure men into texting him very brazen and, to be frank, gross stuff that's found in the interactions below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>While I could understand how someone felt bad for the first guy, it's kind of hard to feel any semblance of pity for Nino, especially with the charming conversational skill he possesses.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Right now, Nino's very excited at the prospect of seeing even naughtier pictures from our friend Michael.

The fact that he kind of laughs at it is sort of redeeming, I guess?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>If you check out his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account you can see more of his texting misadventures here</a>, but I'm not sure how all of these people are magically "wrong number" texting him.
