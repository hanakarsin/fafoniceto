He was 85 years old. The <a href=#>NFL</a> issued a press release announcing the tragedy on Tuesday, Dec. 28, 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did John Madden die?</h2><p>John passed away on Dec. 28, 2021. His cause of death has not been announced. He had a few injuries during his career, including the knee injury that marked the end of his time as a Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle, but he hasn't talked about a health condition publicly in recent years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John Madden forged a career as a supremely successful NFL coach, beloved broadcaster, and the face of 'Madden NFL.'</h2><p>Born on April 10, 1936, in Austin, Minn., John forged a career as one of the most successful coaches in the <a href=#>NFL</a> after suffering a knee injury while attending the Philadelphia Eagles training camp in 1958. On Dec. 26, 1959, he married Virginia Fields. They share two sons, Joseph and Michael.</p><p>He landed one of his first coaching gigs at the Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, Calif., in 1960. By 1962, he was promoted to the head coach position. He joined the Oakland Raiders in 1967, working with Al Davis.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Soon enough, he became the head coach, breaking a record as the youngest head coach to serve in the NFL at the time. (<a href=#>Sean McVay</a> was the latest to break the record in 2017, upon joining the Los Angeles Rams. He was close to 31 at the time.)</p><p>With a 103-32-7 regular-season record and a .759 winning average, John is frequently hailed as one of the most successful coaches out there. The players he worked with at Oakland Raiders include George Blanda and Ray Guy. John retired from the Oakland Raiders in 1978, because of a stomach ulcer and fatigue. "I gave it everything I have," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John Madden first set his sights on sportscasting in the the late 1970s, swiftly transforming the sector.</h2><p>John joined CBS as a commentator in 1979, quickly earning unmatched popularity with his insightful approach and immensely charismatic personality. He appeared in NFL Monday Night Football, The NFC Championship Game, NFL on FOX, among others.</p><p>As John Elway told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, what John Madden said while on air mattered a great deal to the players.</p><p>"When John Madden says it, you don’t really take it as criticism, you kind of critique it to figure out whether he’s right or wrong," he said. "With other guys, you might say, 'Well, that's not right.' If he said it, it kind of made you think twice because of the respect that he had."</p><p>"He had a great way of communicating the game to where as a player it never felt like he was being offensive," John Elway added. "He was getting the message across to the fans, but he wasn’t doing it at the expense of the players."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's no wonder John Madden has video game series, 'Madden NFL,' 'Madden Football,' and 'John Madden Football,' named after him.</h2><p>Younger generations will recognize John Madden from the iconic video game series. John provided the voiceover for the game, and he was involved in the creative development. John's collaboration with EA Tiburon and EA Sports began back in the 1980s.</p><p>Our condolences go out to John's family and friends at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2ain527brnAnZuepl2ZtqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./415529-johnsone-sakaja-shows-impressive-lush-green-compound-car-collection-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnson Sakaja Shows Off His Impressive Lush Green Compound, Car Collection</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bae-suzy-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bae Suzy - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
