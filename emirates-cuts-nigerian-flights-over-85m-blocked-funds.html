This means that not only are Emirates’ revenues accumulating, but we also have to send hard currency into Nigeria to sustain our operation. Meanwhile, our revenues are out of reach and not even earning credit interest.</p><p>“Your Excellency, this is not a decision we have taken lightly. Indeed, we have made every effort to work with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to find a solution to this issue. Our Senior Vice-President met with the Deputy Governor of the CBN in May and followed up on the meeting by letter to the Governor himself the following month, however, no positive response was received. Meetings were also held with Emirates bank in Nigeria and in collaboration with IATA to discuss improving FX allocation, but with limited success.</p><p>“Despite our considerable efforts, the situation continues to deteriorate. We are now in the unfortunate position of having to cut flights, to mitigate against further losses going forward.</p><p>“While we appreciate that this issue is primarily a financial one, any support you could kindly provide would be warmly welcomed by Emirates. We are confident that your valuable involvement would make a real difference in improving this very difficult situation.</p><p>“Should there be any positive development in the coming days, we will of course re-evaluate this decision. Meanwhile thank you for your understanding and please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss the matter further.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5JpZp6lmaeutbHSZpqurKNiu6qzxKugmqZdm7mqs8etqmanppq%2FboSUpmSbpJ%2BYuKawjJ%2Bsp5yjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./404619-kenyans-concerned-covid-19-vaccines-disappear-jack-mas-donations-its-govt-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenyans concerned COVID-19 vaccines could disappear like Jack Ma's donations: &amp;quot;It's the same gov't&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blair-butler-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blair Butler - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
