Beyond the US borders, their fans referred to them as ''Blaque Ivory.'' With such a promising start, the R&B and pop singers' fans have been curious to find out what happened to Blaque.</p><h2>Who is Blaque?</h2><p class=align-left>Blaque is an American all-girl group that was founded in 1999. The original Blaque members were Natina Reed, Shamari Fears, and Brandi Williams. The name Blaque means "Believing in Life and Achieving a Quest for Unity in Everything''.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/215cbe58da258937.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Patti McGuire: 5 interesting facts about Jimmy Connors' wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The crew released a ton of hit singles off their two albums, self-titled 'Blaque' (1999) and ''Blaque Out'' (2002). Years after their sophomore album, the trio went under and resurfaced in 2019.</p><p class=align-left>Natina Reed formed the group in 1996 and was joined by her high school friend, Shamari. Brandi joined them shortly afterward. While singing jingles to earn an extra coin, Reed met Ronald Lopes, who introduced her to his sister, TLC's Lisa Lopes, otherwise known as ''Lisa Left Eye.''</p><p class=align-left>After hearing them perform, Lisa officially signed the group to her company, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Left Eye Productions</a>. The company sought to form, mentor, manage, and promote solo or group talents of many genres from all over the globe.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the other artists signed to the company were Silhouette, Face Man, Shaunda, and Rusx. So, is Natina related to Left Eye? No, the two connected through the band, which became Lisa's protege, especially during its formative years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bd9bc6ba8c4c631f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best rappers from Detroit: Top hip hop artists, ranked</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lisa's influence on the group's maiden album, 'Blaque', was unmistakable.
