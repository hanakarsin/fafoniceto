So, what happened?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Fabio Lanzoni?</h2><p>Fabio took up an interest in modeling at an exceptionally early age. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, he landed his first job when he turned 14.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the family had an illustrious path set out for him — his factory-owner dad wanted him to become an engineer and take over the family business — life had other plans in store.</p><p>As the anecdote has it, it only took the young man stepping inside the Ford Models agency in Manhattan, and within a matter of minutes, he had a contract.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked for the likes of Gap and Nintendo before discovering his real niche — romance novel covers. That's when his career entered into full swing. At one point, he posed for as many as 16 covers in a single day, People notes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>He landed his first-ever acting role in 1990, playing an angel in The Exorcist III.&nbsp;</p><p>In a few years' time, he added TV shows like Dangerous Curves, Acapulco H.E.A.T., and Boogies Diner to his ever-expanding acting portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>In no time, Fabio garnered a cult-like following, with thousands of fans keeping up-to-date with his movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Not one to miss out on an ample opportunity, he launched a 1-900 number and an album, "Fabio After the Dark." He also published novels like Pirate and Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1999, however, something truly horrendous had happened to the Italian dreamboat. Fabio was struck in the face by a goose during a roller coaster ride on the Apollo's Chariot in Busch Gardens&nbsp;Williamsburg, Va.</p><p>Fortunately, he recovered in a relatively short time, and his career as a model and actor was back on track within weeks.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>During the early 2000s, Fabio appeared in movies like Dude, Where's My Car?,<strong> </strong>Bubble Boy, and American Fusion, and TV shows like Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide and Comedy Gumbo.&nbsp;</p><p>He also worked as a spokesperson for a number of brands, including Geek Squad and the American Cancer Society.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he hasn't been as active as he was during his glory days, Fabio still embarks on creative projects every now and then. According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, his next movie, Age of Stone and Sky: The Warlock's Curse, is set to come out in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>As to his love life? It appears that Fabio prefers to keep his personal affairs tightly under wraps, but it seems as though that model has kept his bachelor status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSfmZKevA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacida-carter-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacida Carter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./foxy-brown-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Foxy Brown - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
