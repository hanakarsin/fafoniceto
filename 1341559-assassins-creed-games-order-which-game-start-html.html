Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h3><ul><li><strong>Release: </strong>October 5, 2018</li><li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox One</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d3036a05b79e840a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which is the best Total War game in the entire series?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><i>Odyssey</i>, which was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released in late 2018</a>, takes place several hundred years before <i>Origins</i>. It focuses on the Hellenic world and the Peloponnesian War and allows the player to choose which side they wish to fight for.</p><p class=align-left>The game also allows the player to pick between two protagonists whose names are Alexios and Kassandra. Both are mercenaries and descendants of King Leonidas.</p><p class=align-left>It features plenty of RPG elements, a huge open world to explore, and a wide selection of weapons. It also marks the return of naval combat, which is similar to what was already seen in Black Flag and Rogue.</p><h3>3.

It is the first game in the series to feature multiple protagonists, as both of the Frye twins, Jacob and Evie, are playable throughout the game.</p><p class=align-left>The only notable additions are a selection of new melee and ranged weapons. The multiplayer aspect of the game was omitted.</p><h3>8. Assassin’s Creed III</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d3036a05b79e840a.jpg><ul><li><strong>Release: </strong>October 30, 2012</li><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStations 3 & 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch</li></ul><p class=align-left>This game ranks high in the Assassin's Creed list as it was developed to take place during the American Revolutionary War.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/178c55e21921679e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top cyberpunk movies on Netflix for you and your loved ones</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The player assumes the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> role of a Native American</a> named Ratonhnhaké:ton who adopts the alias of Connor in order to blend into American society.</p><h3>9.
