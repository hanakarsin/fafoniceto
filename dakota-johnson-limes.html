The video, which was published on March 11, showcased her very colorful home.</p><p>The highlight of the video was her kitchen. While the actress was showcasing her home, she made a comment to the camera, confessing a love for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">limes</a>. But recently, the actress revealed that wasn't entirely true.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dakota Johnson previously touted her love for limes in a video tour of her house.</h2><p>At the beginning of quarantine, Architectural Digest put out a video featuring a tour of Dakota Johnson's home. The tour arguably started the green kitchen trend, as Dakota highlighted her colorful cabinets.</p><p>While showing off her eccentric kitchen set up, the actress drew special attention to the limes plated on the counter next to her.</p><p>"I love limes. I love them," she said, gesturing to them. "They're great and I love them so much, and I like to present them like this in my house."</p><p>Of course, no one who watched the video thought twice about Dakota's confession for her fondness of the citrus fruit, because who would lie about loving limes? Given that green was also a common color in her house (which she said was intentional, as she also loves the color green), it was a simple detail that really pulled the kitchen together.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dakota Johnson recently confessed that she lied about her love of limes.</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the actress revealed that she might've fudged the truth a bit in her interview with Architectural Digest, particularly when it came to her response about her love for the green fruit.</p><p>Jimmy Fallon started the interview by mentioning Dakota's previous over-exuberant response to the limes in her kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>"People were fascinated with your green kitchen and your love of limes," he said. "During the tour, you very clearly stated you loved limes."</p><p>It was then that Dakota made a confession: She doesn't actually like limes. In fact, she's allergic to them!</p><p>"I didn't even actually know that they were in there. I was giving the tour in the kitchen and it was set dressing," she confessed calmly during the call. "I’m allergic to limes. I’m mildly allergic to them — and honeydew melon."</p><p>The actress further confessed that both of the green fruits actually make her tongue itch, so they were just a lovely decoration for the video.</p><p>"It was actually hard to just ignore them, so I just lied," she continued.</p><p>While Dakota also had what looked like limes growing in her backyard, in the video she actually clarified that they were lemons — which she is not allergic to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6su9OaZKOnmKPAsLqMpaCmnaM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-ebling-locked-up-abroad-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Heather Ebling From 'Locked Up Abroad' Now?
