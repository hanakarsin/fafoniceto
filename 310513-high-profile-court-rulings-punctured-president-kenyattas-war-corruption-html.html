They will resort to search warrants only if the suspects do not cooperate.</p><p class=align-left>Critics have widely cautioned that the new directive weakens criminal investigations, citing the irrationality of requesting a suspect to volunteer information that may be used against them. They argue that the element of surprise, as applied in investigations worldwide, is crucial for a successful investigation.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> William Ruto’s absence at Kirinyaga county governor's wedding raises eyebrows</p><p class=align-left>The ruling, which was made after lawyer Tom Ojienda challenged the manner in which the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) had obtained a search warrant against him in relation to a payment made by Mumias Sugar Company, opens a Pandora’s Box, paving the way for subjects of surprise searches to challenge the process. This effectively deflates the war against corruption.</p><p class=align-left>Yet, this is not the first time the Judiciary court has made similar puzzling rulings that appear to obstruct the war on corruption.</p><h2>1. Ojienda shielded from prosecution</h2><p class=align-left>In December 2018, the High Court stopped criminal proceedings against lawyer Ojienda, who was accused of fraudulently acquiring KSh 89 million from Mumias Sugar Company.</p><p class=align-left>The lawyer did not even take plea as a battery of 30 lawyers filed an appeal challenging the legality of his prosecution.</p><p class=align-left>DPP Noordin Haji publicly complained that his office had been crippled as it was stopped from pursuing cases involving the lawyer. Unsurprisingly, the recent ruling on search warrants is also in Ojienda’s favour.</p><h2>2. Anti-Mwilu evidence illegally obtained</h2><p class=align-left>In a move that appeared to set the platform for the latest ruling on search warrants, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu survived criminal prosecution in May 2019 after the High Court suppressed corruption charges against her.</p><p class=align-left>A five-judge bench stated that the charges against her were factually and legally sound for purposes of commencing criminal proceedings; but ruled that the DPP lacked the legal basis to indict Mwilu as the evidence was illegally obtained.</p><h2>3. Waititu’s bogus anticipatory bail</h2><p class=align-left>Ealier the same month, Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu who had been arrested by anti-graft detectives over the irregular award of tenders valued at KSh 588 million, was set free after he was granted an anticipatory bail of KSh 500,000 by Kiambu Magistrate Bryan Khaemba.</p><p class=align-left>It has since emerged that the magistrate issued the orders while on sick leave, not to mention the fact that Judiciary regulations require that only a High Court can issue such orders.</p><p class=align-left>Khaemba has since been suspended over gross misconduct.</p><h2>4. Release of condemned rice</h2><p class=align-left>In February 2019, it emerged that Kenyans would have to consume 10 million kilos of rice the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) had condemned for destruction after a Mombasa court ordered the immediate release of the consignment.</p><p class=align-left>Taxpayers would also have to pay the importer KSh15 million in general damages for Kebs’ “unlawful and illegal detention” of the 10,327 tonnes of rice.</p><p class=align-left>The rice was part of consignments of sugar and rice netted as part of a war against harmful and substandard consumer goods that was led by a multiagency team appointed by the President.</p><h2>5. Swazuri’s return to office</h2><p class=align-left>In 2018, then embattled National Land Commission (NLC) Chairman Muhammad Swazuri got a reprieve after a Nairobi court allowed him to resume office despite facing criminal charges.</p><p class=align-left>Anti-Corruption court Principal Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi ruled that Swazuri, being a constitutional office holder, could not be removed from office simply because he was facing charges.</p><p class=align-left>There were concerns that such a ruling would allow interference with evidence and witnesses, fears that were confirmed when a computer containing crucial evidence that prosecutors relied on in their case against Swazuri later went missing.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a life-changing story you would like us to publish?
