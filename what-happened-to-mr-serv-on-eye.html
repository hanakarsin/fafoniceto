While his trademark track, "Make 'Em Say Ugh" hasn't really aged that well, it became a top summer jam with a catchphrase that's managed to persist until today.&nbsp;</p><p>The label also had a slew of gold and platinum artists, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Serv On</a>. And after watching his recent interviews, fans want to know what happened to his eye?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Mr. Serv-On have a glass eye?</h2><p>It's always a trip to see the artists and celebrities you looked up to as a youngin' all grown up, and because it's been years or maybe decades since you've seen them last, when you finally do get a good look at them, it can be surprising to see how much they've changed.</p><p>The biggest difference folks have noticed with the New-Orleans-based rapper is that his left eye has some discoloration.</p><p>This has led many folks to speculate that Mr. Serv-On, real name Corey Smith, is rocking a glass eye. However, he hasn't discussed this change in his physical appearance in recent interviews. He's primarily discussed the significance of his time spent with other high-level rappers, like being featured on a verse with Big Pun and being the first Southern rapper to actually shoot a music video in Times Square.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>While speaking on the Murder Master Music Show, Mr. Serv-On reminded everyone that the hip-hop landscape was much different in the mid-to late '90s â€” it was still very much an East and West coast-run show with the majority of rappers hailing from New York or California. He took a lot of pride in being one of the first artists from the South to really prove that Southern rap had its own distinct voice that could "hang" with the heavyweights of hip-hop.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When did Mr Serv On get a bionic eye?</p>â€” TEXAS (@BrittanyBeauty) <a href=#>July 30, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man what is wrong with Mr Serv On eye</p>â€” C-32 (@CeeBoogie) <a href=#>July 30, 2020</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Mr. Serv-On sustain an eye injury?</h2><p>Again, it's a topic that's been brought up by many people on social media, but the artist hasn't commented on what happened to his eye. However, we can judge by the blueish-greyish discoloration in his left eye that it's most likely a cataract.</p><p>In metaphorical terms: having a cataract is like having a foggy windshield in your car.

The most common cause of this condition in some people is old age. Many folks who develop cataracts begin experiencing symptoms at around 40 years of age, but it could take several years before they begin to notice an effect on their vision.</p><p>NewtralGroundz.com is slated to launch a documentary titled "The Science of No Limit" that breaks down how Master P's record label was able to make such a huge impact in the hip-hop game.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Mr. Serv-On also dished on Master P's winning album-dropping strategy that put No Limit ahead of the competition, something that Twitter users respected immensely.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mr Serv On said P knew every artist release dates.
