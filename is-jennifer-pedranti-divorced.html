Another cast member making sure we stay abreast of the Southern California show’s tea is newer ‘wife, <a href=#>Jennifer Pedranti</a>.</p><p>Jennifer joined RHOC in Season 17 with her boyfriend, <a href=#>Ryan Boyajian</a>. The pair spent most of the season defending their relationship on and offline.</p><p>Despite the controversy, after four years of dating, Ryan proposed to Jen in April 2024. Jen accepted the proposal, but the engagement will likely be long, considering she’s still technically married to her estranged husband, <a href=#>William Pedranti</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jennifer Pedranti and William Pedranti’s divorce proceedings have been ongoing for over a year.</h2><p>Although fans have only met Jen’s fiance, Ryan, she is still married to another man as of this writing. Jen explained on RHOC that she and William were separated. However, they were still technically living together at their $2.4 million home, though she clarified they never slept in the same bedroom, and Will mostly stayed in Oklahoma for work.</p><p>Though she could admit being in the same house as her estranged husband was “weird,” she said the agreement happened so they could effectively co-parent their <a href=#>five children — Dominic, Everleigh, Dawson, Grayson, and Harrison</a> — who range in age from 5 to 18, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bustle</a>.</p><p>William ultimately filed for divorce in March 2023, and the couple has been battling it out in court to get their divorce settlement together ever since. In February 2024, Jen requested sole custody of her and William’s children and offered to give him visitation rights and the option for shared custody.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jennifer Pedranti (@jennifer.pedranti)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The ‘Real Housewives of Orange County’ filed a sanction against William for over $1,000.</h2><p>Jen also asked that William pay her temporary child and spousal support and accommodate her $20,000 legal fees, stating she couldn’t afford the life they had with her yoga studio and RHOC money alone.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RadarOnline</a> stated in April 2024 that Jen asked William to hand over financial records that would help her see how much income her ex makes after he claimed not to have any income from his businesses to pay her spousal support.</p><p>When William asked for an extension, Jen disagreed and demanded he pay her $1,900 in sanctions. The issue was settled in court on April 12, 2024, with the judge making William send his financial documents in May.
