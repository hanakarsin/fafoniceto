But the swift intervention of Capt. Chris Najomo, DGCA, has eased the situation. More wins to come.”</p><p>The acting director-general of the NCAA, Chris Najomo, on the 12th of February expressed concern over the high cost of airfares, especially on international routes.</p><p>Najomo said the authority would set up a committee to review the situation and bring down the airfares.</p><p>He said, “It has come to the notice of this authority about the increase and high cost of airfares, especially on international travels.</p><p>“And NCAA in a view of trying to make sure that these airfares are brought down, has decided to set up a high-powered committee which will look at all the variances and how we can bring these airfares down.</p><p>“We’ve met with the airlines and other stakeholders and other agencies we will make sure that this is done.”</p><p>Some foreign aviation firms operating in Nigeria are Lufthansa German Airlines, KLM, Egypt Air, Ethiopian Airlines, British Airways, Royal Air Maroc, RwandAir, and Turkish Airlines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49qZp%2Bnopq2qLqMmqCrpJmjsrR50Z6brpuVqHqxvsicnGanlmLBqq%2FKnqtmnp%2Bneq%2B1xp6popmeqHqistOeqWael6h6qrrTnqmvnZ6ptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./about-u-kpop-victor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>K-Pop Band About U's Victor Was Fired for Allegedly Breaking Drumstick</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-liz-cheat-on-ed-90-day-fiance-happily-ever-after.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Liz Cheat on Ed?
