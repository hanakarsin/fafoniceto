While separating from a spouse can feel like it’s the end of the world, many <a href=#>divorcees</a> see it as a new beginning. @No-Sandwich1817, a poster on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Am I the A------” subreddit</a>, found this out firsthand.</p><p>After spending years as “a maid for the family” — “not to mention” she was “working at the same time” — this Redditor needed a reset. Following the OP’s split from her now ex-husband, they split custody of their two teenage kids.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images; Reddit</span></figure><p>Thanks to her newfound free time, @No-Sandwich1817 even got a chance to take on a new hobby.</p><p>However, things went left for the OP when her 17-year-old son made an offer she had to refuse.</p><p>On the eve of a bake sale, he asked @No-Sandwich1817 to whip up some <a href=#>cupcakes</a> — and her reply might surprise you. <strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: She said no.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This parent refused to bake cupcakes for her son’s bake sale and got a thumbs up from the internet.</h2><p>According to the OP, the divorce from her ex was “a bit rough” on their kids — whose ages range from 14 to 17. That said, the breakup was a dream come true for @No-Sandwich1817.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“It’s wonderful to have ‘days off’ — so much new free time when they are not home. So I have been able to explore new hobbies,” she shared in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AITA forum</a> on Reddit.</p><p>“So I joined a models club, you build models and show them off. We [meet] once a month to show off our creations, I love it.”</p><p>The OP was off to a meeting for her club when she was approached by her teen, who was in a panic. “My 17-year-old messed up this week [and] volunteered for a bake sale. [He] didn’t tell me and forgot to make cupcakes.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>“He asked me if I could do it and I told him no since I was leaving,” her post continued, adding that her son had also made plans that evening. “He was also leaving to hang out with his friend.”</p><p>Needless to say, the cupcakes for the bake sale went unmade, which triggered a family feud.</p><p>“We got in a huge fight about me not helping him out. I wasn’t putting my life on hold for a simple mistake he did,” she went on. ”He left for his father’s and my ex also got into an argument with me about it and called me a jerk.”</p><p>The OP added: “I’m running out of time before college and he is with the man he [learns] this behavior from half the time.”</p><p>She ended her post with a plea for advice on how to deal with her son’s disrespect, and she got plenty of replies. The general consensus was that the OP was not the a------ in this situation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>“NTA. Your son was irresponsible, you weren't. He is awfully entitled, too,” Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Jolly_Tooth_7274</a> commented. “But beyond that, I think you're carrying a bit of trauma from your marriage and projecting it on your relationship with your kids.”</p><p>“It was as simple as saying, ‘Lack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine.’ No need to go all dramatic about how ‘I'm not putting my life on hold for you." That was completely unnecessary.”</p><p>So, what do you think? Who was really in the wrong in this cupcake conundrum?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6zsc2tZKudlqrApr%2BMraZmpZGgsm6v1KmamqOVqHqnu9Fmqqimo2KvorfEZqqapJU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-yang-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Yang - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-herbal-concoction-sellers-add-antibiotics-other-tables-to-mixtures-for-effective-results.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Herbal Concoction Sellers Add Antibiotics, Other Tablets To Mixtures For Effective Results</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./embrace-dialogue-to-solve-insecurity-masari-tells-buhari.html>Embrace Dialogue To Solve Insecurity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-2.html>Fans Are Thrilled That 'Power Book IV: Force' Has Officially Been Renewed for Season 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-does-heather-martin-know-matt-james.html>How Does Heather Martin Know Matt James?
