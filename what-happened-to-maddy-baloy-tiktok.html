In one video, Maddy documented 19 of the 20 things on her bucket list that she wanted to cross off before her death.</p><p>That list included one item that made headlines, which was meeting chef Gordon Ramsay.</p><p>Maddy got to do exactly that when the two had dinner together at one of Gordon’s Florida restaurants. Maddy was then invited to the opening of Gordon’s new restaurant Lucky Cat in South Beach.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I’m truly at a loss for words by the sad news we received today about the loss of (Madison),” Gordon said following news of her death. “She was kind, fun, and a true inspiration to me and my three girls.
